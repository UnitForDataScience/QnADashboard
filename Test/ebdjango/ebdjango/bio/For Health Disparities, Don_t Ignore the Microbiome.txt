For Health Disparities,
Don't Ignore the Microbiome
When considering health disparities among different groups, look to the microbiome as a factor, say researchers at the National Hu- man Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), part of the National Institutes of Health. In a recent in Trends in Microbiol- ogy, authors from the NHGRI, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and Perel- man School of Medicine introduced a new "conceptual framework" for human health and disease that integrates the micro- biome, the social and physical environ- ment, and biological processes.
The authors noted that racial and ethnic disparities in the incidence of conditions in- cluding asthma, cardiovascular disease, dia- betes, obesity, preterm birth, and sickle cell disease may be caused by a host of factors ranging from genetics to lifestyle to pollu- tion. Genetic variation and differing expo- sures to environmental factors, such as diet and stress, may influence the microbial mi- lieu in and on the human body, resulting in health disparities.
For each of the aforementioned health problems, there is evidence that micro- biome variations in different groups may contribute to disease disparities. For ex- ample, suggests that differences in the composition of the vaginal microbiome may play a role in higher rates of bacterial vaginosis and preterm birth in African Ameri- can women relative to women of European ancestry.
The authors called for investigators across disciplines--basic and computa- tional scientists, clinicians, social and behav- ioral scientists, and epidemiologists--to col- laborate on health disparities research that takes into account the "whole person," in- cluding the microbiome.
"We mustuse all the tools at our disposal-- the study of genomics, the human micro- biome, and interactions with behavioral and social processes of health and disease--to better understand and find solutions to health disparities," Vence L. Bonham, Jr, JD, a coauthor on the perspective and associate investigator in NHGRI's Social and Behav- ioral Research Branch, told JAMA.

VHA Initiative Reduces Risky Opioid Prescribing
In October 2013, the Veterans Health Ad- ministration (VHA) implemented an "audit and feedback" program to reduce high- dose opioid prescriptions and potentially le- thal drug combinations at all 141 of its hos- pitals across the country. A study in the journal suggests that effort--called the (OSI)--was a moderate success.
The study, led by researchers at the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System and the Uni- versity of Michigan Medical School, ana- lyzed data from all adult VHA patients who filled outpatient opioid prescriptions be- tween October 2012 and September 2014. Over this study period, the number of VHA patients prescribed daily opioid dos- ages of more than 100 morphine equiva- lents (MEQ) decreased 16%, from 55 722 to 46 780 patients. Patients receiving very high, daily dose opioids (>200 MEQ) decreased 24%, from 19 952 to 15 121 patients. The total number of patients receiving opioids also decreased from 571 476 to 514 883--a 10%
reduction--over the study period.
Additionally, 21% fewer patients were prescribed both opioids and benzodiaz- epines, a decrease from 112 907 to 89 564 patients. When taken together, these medi- cations can cause fatal overdoses.
A main feature of the OSI is an elec- tronic medical record dashboard tool that audits opioid-related prescribing. As part of the program, a clinical leader at each hospi- tal was chosen to review how the drugs were being prescribed, compare this with re- gional and national data, and give feedback to individual prescribers. Clinical leaders were also encouraged to educate clinicians about pain care and opioid prescribing.
"[T]he VA's experience with the OSI pro- vides a potential model for how to influ- ence prescriber behavior through system- level interventions," said Mark Ilgen, PhD, lead author of the study.

Public-Private Partnership Speeds Investigator Access to Cancer Drugs
A new collaboration between pharma- ceutical and biotech companies and the



















The microbiome may be an overlooked factor influencing health disparities.


National Cancer Institute (NCI) at the Na- tional Institutes of Health aims to get can- cer drugs into the hands of researchers-- and patients--faster. The will allow NCI-Designated Cancer Center inves- tigators to move quickly through the pro- cess to access drugs for preclinical studies and clinical trials.
The program launched in January with a suite of  from 6 pharmaceutical companies, including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly and Company, and Genentech. Under the arrangement, participating companies must approve or reject investigator pro- posals within 60 days--a process that can typically take up to 18 months.
Critically, the NCI Formulary facilitates the testing of targeted therapies that com- bine agents from different companies.
The partnership "represents a new drug development paradigm that will enhance the efficiency with which new treatments are discovered," James Doro- show, MD, NCI deputy director for clinical and translational research, said in a Doroshow added that he expects to double the number of compa- nies and drugs in the program by the end of 2017.- Jennifer Abbasi
