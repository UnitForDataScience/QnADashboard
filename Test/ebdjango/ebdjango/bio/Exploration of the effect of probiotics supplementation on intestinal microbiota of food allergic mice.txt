Abstract: Environmental factor-induced alterations in intestinal microbiota have been demonstrated to be associat- ed with increasing prevalence of food allergy. However, it is not clear to what extent oral administration of probiotics can affect gut microbiota composition, thus inhibiting food allergy development. Using ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized murine model, it was demonstrated that probiotics ameliorated allergic symptoms, including reducing OVA specific- IgE, and -IgG1 levels in the serum, Th2 cytokines release in spleen, and occurrence of diarrhea. Moreover, 16S rRNA analysis showed that the probiotics-mediated protection was conferred by an enrichment of Coprococcus and Rikenella. The present study supports the theory that probiotics can treat food allergy by modulating specific genera of the gut microbiota.

Introduction

Food allergy is an adverse immune response to certain kinds of food. It is estimated that food allergy affects about 8% of children and 4% of adults [1, 2]. The rapid increase in the preva- lence of food allergy over past several decades cannot be explained by genetic variation alone. In current, avoidance of dietary allergens is the only proven remedy available for food allergic suffers.
Growing evidence suggests that gut microbiota exerts profound influence on immune system maturation and tolerance acquisition. Intestinal microflora alteration, caused by environmental factors (e.g., mode of birth, antibiotics, diet, vaccination, sanitation), has been observed to be associated with many gastrointestinal dis- eases, including food allergy [3], inflammatory bowel diseases [4], or colorectal cancer [5-8]. Of note, intestinal microflora has been demon- strated to play an important role in maintaining the  Th1/Th2  balance  [9],  which  is  the  key mechanism involved in allergic diseases.

The role of probiotics in allergic disease has been highlighted recently. Bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, which are common species of pro- biotics existing in most people, can affect immune function by various pathways. In many cases, probiotics supplementation was demon- strated to induce TGF-b expression, which ameliorates food allergy by suppressing Th2 response, and inducing Foxp3+ Treg production [10-15]. A microarray analysis of intestinal epi- thelial cells from gnotobiotic mice revealed a mechanism that Clostridia facilitated immune cells to produce interleukin-22 (IL-22), regulat- ed innate lymphoid cell function and intestinal epithelial permeability to protect against aller- gen sensitization [3]. Besides, the suppressive effect of probiotics on Th17 response has been shown both in murine asthma [16] and atopic dermatitis model [17]. However, whether probiotics treatment elicited changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota, there- by regulating allergic disease remains poorly understood.
The current study investigated the beneficial
effect  of  Bifidobacterium  Infantis  (BB)  in a

murine model of food allergy at the level of commensal microbiota. Sequencing of the V4-V5 regions of 16S rRNA genes revealed that BB could modulate specific genera of intestinal microbiota in mice, which may induce immune responses in gastrointestinal tract to defend against food allergens.
Materials and methods

Animals

All the animal experimental procedures were conducted according to the guidelines appro- ved by the Experimental Animal Ethic Com- mittee at Shenzhen University, and were car- ried out in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH publication no. 85-23, revised 1996). 6-8 weeks old female Balb/c mice were housed in a SPF animal facility with a 12 h light-dark cycle and were free to access standard diet and water.

Food allergic animal model

Mice were intragastrically administered with 100 mg OVA plus 20 mg cholera toxin (CT) in a final volume of 300 ml using a ball-end mouse feeding tube once a week for 4 consecutive weeks. At the end of sensitization, mice were challenged with 5 mg OVA orally. After 24 h, the mice were killed and serum and splenocytes were collected for the following analysis as reported previously (referred to as FA group) [25].
BB preparation and supplementation

BB was kindly provided by Shenzhen Kexing Biotech CO., LTD (Shenzhen, China) as lyophi- lized powder and inoculated before giving to mice. From Day 15 to Day 28, sensitized mice were orally administered with 200 ml/mouse of normal saline containing 108 cfu/ml as previously described (referred to as FAPro group) [13]. On day 29, the mice were chal- lenged as described above.

while blue represents negative correlation.


Serum immunoglobulin levels

Serum was collected, and OVA-specific IgE was detected by commercial ELISA kit (Biolegend, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruc- tions. OVA-specific IgG1 was measured by an in-house ELISA as previously described [26].
DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing

During the process of food allergy model estab- lishment, fecal samples (up to ~1 g) were col- lected on Day 0, 7,  14, 28, 29, and stored at
-80degC. The total DNA from fecal samples was extracted by reported method [27].  The 16S

rRNA was amplified and sequenced on the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine as reported in previous study [28].
Bioinformatics analysis

The data was treated with in-house pipeline developed based on mothur v.1.33.3 [29]. The community structure was calculated based on the membership and relative abundance of taxonomic groups in the sample. In this study, the Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was used to assess the effect of BB (covariate) on operational taxonomic units (OTUs) profiles. A two-tailed

Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used in the profile to identify the different OTUs and KEGG Orthologs (KOs). In addition, we used PICRUSt
[30] to produce predicted KOs from the 16S rRNA gene sequence data.
Statistical analysis

In Figure 1, all values are presented as the means +- SEM. Differences between two groups were evaluated with the Student t test, while data among three or more groups were evalu- ated with one-way ANOVA (Prism version 5, GraphPad Software; CA, USA). A P value less than 0.05 was considered to indicate signifi- cant differences.
Results

BB showed significant protective effect on food
allergic mice

Food allergic mice model was established using OVA as allergen, CT as adjuvant. As shown in

Figure 1A and 1B, treatment with BB for two weeks attenuated sIgE and sIgG1 by 33% and 32% respectively, when compared with FA group. Moreover, spleneocytes were harvested from all the three groups of mice and incu- bated with OVA for 3 days. The levels of typical Th2-type cytokines in supernatant were deter- mined by commercial ELISA. Intragastrically administered with BB significantly reduced IL-4,
-5, and -13 by 31%, 24%, and 50% respectively in FA mice (Figure 1C). In addition, after chal- lenge with OVA, the FA mice showed significant diarrhea (Figure 1D), which could be amelio- rated by BB.

BB-induced phenotypic improvement was as-
sociated with specific OTUs

Next, to investigate the effect of BB on gut microbiome, we carried out metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples from FA and FAPro mice. All sequencing reads were finally classi- fied into 1195 operational taxonomic units

diversity [20]. The higher Shannon index indicates the greater community diversity, while the higher Simpson index indicates the lesser community diversity. We used these 4 kinds of alpha diver- sity parameters to describe the microbiologic species di- versity changes between FA group and FAPro group (Figure 3). Student's t-test showed that there were no significant differences of these four indexes (Figure 3). The re- sults indicated that BB was not strong enough to change population diversity and rich- ness of intestinal microbiota.

The PCoA of OTU profile between FA and FAPro mice. 16S rRNA gene surveys (analyzed by JSD-based PCoA) from mice fed PBS (red) or pro- biotics (blue) diets are presented in a different clustering pattern. Principal coordinate1 (PC)1 and PC2 are the x axis and y axis, respectively, and have been scaled on the basis of percent variance.

In order to investigate wheth- er probiotics treatment chan- ge the composition of in- testinal microbiota, we used principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) to compare FA and FAPro group. As shown in Figure 4, there was no signifi-

(OTUs). The correlation between food allergic phenotypes and OTUs was calculated. It was found that 61 OTUs were significantly related to sIgE, sIgG1, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Among them, 45 OTUs were positively correlated with these phenotypes and 16 OTUs were negatively cor- related (Figure 2). For instance, Otu0724, annotated to the family S24-7, was significantly positive correlated with allergic phenotypes. On the contrary, Otu0543, annotated to the genus Bacteroides, was significantly negatively corre- lated. Upregulation or downregulation of the relative abundances of these OTUs could trig- ger certain immune responses. The results indicated that BB treatment may change immune indexes of food allergy through modu- lation of these OTUs.

Treatment with BB shows no effect on alpha- diversity of intestinal microflora

Chao [18] and ACE [19] are usually used to compute community richness; the higher score, the more richness. Shannon and Simpson met- rics are commonly used to calculate community

cant difference between FA and FAPro group. Thus, it was implied that BB showed no effect on modulation of microbiota composition.
The taxonomic classification of gut microbiota
in mice

We found that Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were two most prevalent phyla present in food allergic mice treated with or without probi- otics, the same as that under physiological status [3]. Furthermore, Lachnospiraceae, S24-7, Rikenellaceae, and Ruminococcaceae accounted for four major components at family levels (Figure 5A). Further analysis revealed that 2-wk of BB treatment resulted in a significant change in fecal microbiota composition at genus level. As shown in Figure 5B, the levels of Coprococcus and Rikenella were significantly increased by 66% and 60% respectively, after BB treatment. Thus, the relative abundances of Coprococcus and Rikenella may be used as microbial biomarkers to diagnose food allergy.

(FAPro2), after two weeks' administration (FAPro3), 1 h after allergen challenge (FA- Pro4), 24 h after allergen challenge (FAPro5). Intriguing- ly, we selected 12 most abundant genera and found that at least 6 genera  of  gut bacteria, including Odo- ribacter, Bacteroides, Copro- coccus, Blautia, Eubacterium, Prevotella changed with time after probiotics treatment (Figure 7). For example, the levels of Odoribacter were significantly increased by 3.3 fold at the time point of 24 h after challenge compared to the time point of 1 h after challenge.

We used PICRUSt to produce predicted metagenomes from 16S rRNA gene sequence database. 143 KOs were found to be significantly differ- ent between FA and FAPro mice, using Wilcoxon rank test, p value < 0.05. Among them, only 4 KOs were enriched in FAPro group (Table

FAPro mice

Next, Wilcoxon rank test showed that 92 OTUs were significantly different between FA group and FAPro group. Among them, 40 OTUs (43.5%) were enriched in FA group. 33 OTUs were picked out through a FDR adjust and make a heatmap with the OTU percentage profile (Figure 6). Moreover, we found that probiotics administration could enrich more bacteria assigned to Coprococcus, Rikenella and Bacteroides in the mice gut (Figure 6).
Mice gut microflora changed across time

In order to monitor the change of gut bacteria during the period of probiotics administration, we collected fecal samples at 5 time points: before oral treatment of probiotics (FAPro1), after one week's probiotics administration

1). The results implied that BB supplementa- tion significantly modified metabolic pathways of gut microbiota.
Discussion

Gut microbiota plays an important role in the pathogenesis of food allergy. In this study, we found that oral administration of BB induced significant improvement on allergic symptoms in mice. Furthermore, the results demonstrat- ed that BB conferred a protective effect on food allergic mice through up-regulation of the relative abundance of Coprococcus and Rikenella at genus level. Furthermore, the genera of gut microflora were presented in a time-dependent pattern after BB treatment.

Growing evidence suggests that the relation- ship among diet, probiotics, immune system and gut microbiota ecology determines the dis-

able [24]. Therefore, in order to further determine the differ- ent components of intestinal microbiota caused by probiot- ics, we chose state-of-the-art next-generation sequencing method to detect the 16S rRNA of faces samples and determine the frequency of microbes and its metabolic pathway in gastrointestinal tract. We found that there were 12 genera of gut bacteria existing in both FA and FAPro groups. After supplementation with BB for two weeks, each genus changed periodically. Based on their relative abun- dances, BB administration could up-regulate Rikenlla and down-regulate Eubacterium. These two genera of bacteria have never been highlighted by other related researches. Instead, Stefka [3] et al dem- onstrated that a Clostridia- containing microbiota was

ease susceptibility to allergy [21]. Thus, it is
very likely that intragastrical administration of probiotics may treat food allergy by restoring the unbalanced indigenous microbiota and controlling the inflammatory responses. Until now, there is no investigation targeting the direct effect of probiotic supplementation on intestinal microbiota. Although there are more than 1000 species of intestinal bacteria, most of them belong to just a few phyla. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla dominate the adult intes- tine. The intestinal microbiota is of high varia- tion from people to people at species-level, but bifidobacteria and lactobacilli are common spe- cies existing in most people [22]. Thus, in the present study we chose BB to treat a classical animal model sensitized by OVA. In this study, animals treated with probiotics for two weeks showed improvement in all major indicators of experimental mucosal allergy, in line with the results previously reported [23].
When use traditional culture based techniques to determine the composition of the gut micro- biota, there are only ~10% of gut bacteria pos- sibly to be studied since others are not cultur-

associated with innate lymphoid cell function
and intestinal epithelial permeability. The diver- gence may be attributed to that they didn't use a kind of probiotics to treat allergic mice.
In conclusion, this is the first study to explore microbial population changes in food allergic animal model, in case of probiotics administra- tion. Likely, specific gut bacterial changes con- tributed to disease process altered by probiot- ics. Still, patients study are warranted in the future to determine whether the findings herein reported can be validated and correlated with the clinical features.
