1  |  INTRODUCTION 

Candida species colonise the gastrointestinal and reproductive tract and skin of most individuals and are among the most common causes of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections in the United States.1,2  In healthy persons, carriage of Candida albicans is estimated at 30%- 60%.3 However, Candida species can also act as opportunistic patho- gens that are capable of infecting a broad range of body sites, especially when host resistance mechanisms are compromised. Candidaemia, when Candida gains access to the bloodstream, is a life-threatening


condition, with mortality rate estimates of nearly 50%,4 especially in immunocompromised patients.
Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients present a unique combina- tion of risk factors that may predispose them to candidaemia, including prolonged administration of immunosuppressive therapies, repeated courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics, haemodialysis, various surgical procedures and presence of central venous catheters.5,6 SBT recipi- ents evince a higher incidence of allograft rejection than other SOT recipients, due to the high immunogenicity of the bowel, and therefore require more potent immunosuppression therapy.7 During episodes of

allograft rejection or breach of the gastrointestinal tract during sur- gery, breakdown of the gut epithelial barrier occurs, which can lead to the translocation of enteric organisms from the recipient or donor bowel into the bloodstream or peritoneum.
Small bowel transplantation is considered a last-resort treatment option for paediatric patients with extreme short bowel syndrome or those suffering life-threatening complications from parenteral nutri- tion. Bloodstream infections are common complications following intestinal transplant and represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality among SBT recipients, with up to 70% of paediatric SBT re- cipients developing bloodstream infections.8 In particular, paediatric SBT recipients experience an increased incidence of candidaemia, with up to 25% of recipients developing candidaemia--the most common fungal bloodstream infection in this population.9
Strains implicated in candidaemia may be of endogenous or ex- ogenous origin.10 The donor and remnant recipient bowel may each harbour commensal fungi,6 and donor organs may additionally become infected during hospitalisation of the donor or during procurement and preservation of the organ.10,11 There is increasing evidence for Candida infections originating from the hospital environment and per- sonnel, contaminated implanted medical devices, or from the skin.12-14 The ability of Candida to produce biofilms on catheter instruments is a common source of candidaemia episodes, as these give the yeast direct access into the bloodstream upon insertion.15
Antifungal prophylaxis is commonly administered in the first weeks after surgery in SBT recipients. However, extensive use of anti- fungal prophylaxis can select for resistant Candida strains. For instance the recent clinical emergence of azole-resistant species (Candida gla- brata and Candida krusei) is likely due to widespread use of fluconazole and other antifungal agents.16 In addition, an overall shift towards non-C. albicans species commonly associated with fungaemia has been observed,17 possibly related to the extensive use of antifungal prophylaxis.
In the present work, we defined the gut mycobiota of SBT recip- ients and genotyped ileum and bloodstream Candida isolates in at- tempt to infer the source of infection, and determine the distribution of isolates within and between patients. Isolates were also assessed for antifungal susceptibility. Overall, the data obtained in this study will contribute to the knowledge base of Candida epidemiology and infections acquired by SBT recipients and will also help design future studies.


2  |  MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Seven paediatric short bowel syndrome patients who underwent SBT and later developed candidaemia at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) were included in this study. The patient co- hort comprised three females and four males with a mean age of
23.1 months (median: 20 months; range: 16-37 months). UNMC is   a premier facility for SBT, conducting approximately 20 transplants per year. Ileostomy and blood samples (Table 1) were collected from recipients under UNMC Institutional Review Board protocol

#417-02, and informed consent was  received  from  the  caregiv- ers of all patients. Candidaemia was diagnosed on the basis of at least one sample isolated in pure culture from the blood, which was then identified by the API 20 C test (BioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Multiple ileostomy samples were collected posttransplant during hospitalisation from each patient and stored at -80degC until processing.
To obtain pure culture isolates from ileostomy samples, approx- imately 250 mL of ileal effluent was grown at 37degC in liquid media (yeast nitrogen broth [YNB; 6.7 g/L yeast nitrogen base, 10 g/L glu- cose,   0.76 g/L   l-asparagine,   50 mg/L   chloramphenicol,   20 mg/L gentamicin sulphate], and yeast extract peptone dextrose broth [YPD; 10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone, 20 g/L glucose, 50 mg/L chloramphenicol, pH 5.6]) to restore cells that may have been dam- aged by up to 10 years storage at -80degC with possible exposure to freeze-thaw cycles and to increase the volume available for plating. Volumes of 100 mL were plated after 24, 48 and 72 hours on YPD agar (supplemented with 50 mg/L chloramphenicol), CHROMagar Candida (Paris, France), potato dextrose agar (PDA, Oxoid; supplemented with 50 mg/L chloramphenicol) and dichloran rose bengal chlorampheni- col agar (DRBC; 10 g/L glucose, 5 g/L peptone, 1 g/L monopotassium phosphate, 0.5 g/L magnesium sulphate, rose bengal 0.025 g/L, di- chloran 0.002 g/L chloramphenicol 0.10 g/L). Multiple liquid and solid media were used to maximise the chances of isolating fungi. Plates were incubated at 37degC and monitored daily for 2 weeks. Multiple col- onies from each plate were further isolated on the basis of colour and morphology.
DNA was extracted from yeast cultures following the methods   of Harju et al.18 DNA from each ileostomy sample and pure culture isolate was selectively amplified by PCR using fungal-specific primers ITS1-F and ITS4 as described in Suhr et al.19 To survey the gut mycobi- ota, DNA was extracted directly from ileostomy effluent following the protocol of Oh et al.20
PCR products from ileostomy effluent were cloned using the pGEM(r) -T Easy Vector System Kit (Promega, Lyon, France) following the manufacturer's instructions. For each sample, 25 colonies nega- tive for b-galactosidase activity were evaluated and those with dis- tinct EcoR1 patterns were sequenced on an ABI 3730xl platform at Michigan State University's Research Technology Support Facility (East Lansing, MI, USA). Fungal sequences were identified by sequence homology using nucleotide BLAST against the UNITE curated fun- gal ITS sequence database21 and the curated FUNCBS database, as accessed through the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (  accessed September 2014). Sequences were deposited as GenBank accessions
#KU987836-KU987907.
All C. albicans and C. glabrata ileostomy and bloodstream isolates were typed by MLST as described previously.22,23 After amplification of each fragment, PCR products were purified using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-up Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Subsequently, amplicons were sequenced in both directions using the same primers used for PCR. Sequences were aligned and assembled using ClustalW implemented in BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor version 7.3.2.

For C. albicans, heterozygosities were assessed by visual inspection of the chromatograms and designated using IUPAC nomenclature. Sequences were entered into the respective MLST database (h

  &  t/),  and  assigned an allele profile for each locus which produced a sequence type (ST) based on the entire allelic combination.

Candida albicans, C. glabrata and Candida parapsilosis isolates were also typed by RAPD using the primer Oligo 2 (5'-TCACGATGCA-3') as described previously.24 Candida parapsilosis isolates were further typed with the primer OPE-04 (5'-GTGACATG-3').25 Amplification reactions were as described above for PCR except 10 ng of DNA was used. Amplicons were separated in a 1.5% agarose gel for 90 minutes and visualised.
Antifungal susceptibility was assessed using the Sensititre YeastOne YO-9 plate (TREK Diagnostic Systems, Cleveland, OH, USA), which provides antifungal susceptibility testing and minimum inhibi- tory concentration (MIC) determination against nine antifungals (see Table 2, below), following the manufacturer's instructions. Guidelines for breakpoint interpretations for amphotericin B were determined from CLSI M27-A26; for anidulafungin, caspofungin, fluconazole, mi- cafungin and voriconazole from CLSI M27-S4;27 for 5-flucytosine and itraconazole from CLSI M27-S3,28 and for posaconazole from the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing.29


3  |  RESULTS

The ileal effluent of SBT recipients harboured several fungal species (Table 1). Candida albicans was the predominant species, detected in the ileum of four patients (57%) and 11 out of 28 ileostomy samples (40%). All ileum samples tested contained detectable fungi, and the species detected per sample ranged from 1 to 6. P33 harboured four Candida species in a single ileal sample. Other, non-Candida fungi were also detected in 60% of ileal samples, with Penicillium roqueforti and/or allied species (Penicillium roqueforti, Penicillium carneum and Penicillium paneum cannot reliably be distinguished on the basis of ITS sequence) detected in samples for all patients.
Species isolated from each blood culture are shown in Table 1. All bloodstream infections were caused by Candida. Candida parapsilosis was the predominant species isolated from the bloodstream (three pa- tients). Candida albicans was the second most-isolated species from the bloodstream, in two patients, whereas C. glabrata, C. orthopsilosis and C. pelliculosa (=C. beverwijkiae Wickerhamomyces anomalus) were each isolated from one patient. P74 sustained two distinct blood- stream infections, from C. parapsilosis in July 2006 and from C. albicans in November of 2006.
All C. albicans (n = 3) and C. glabrata (n = 8) isolated in culture from the ileum and bloodstream were subjected to MLST. Twelve alleles were identified among the seven loci of C. albicans isolates, including two new alleles, which generated a new, unique diploid sequence type (Table S1). Fourteen polymorphic nucleotide sites were found be- tween the two C. albicans sequence types. Both C. albicans sequence types detected in this study (ST 2854 & ST 2855) are novel isolates and have been deposited in the MLST database. In addition, two se- quence types (ST 2 & ST 3), consisting of 12 alleles and 23 variable nucleotide sites, were identified among the six loci of C. glabrata iso- lates (Table S1).
For P33, ileostomy and blood C. albicans isolates yielded one se- quence type (ST 2854). Candida albicans causing bloodstream infection

in P74 was ST 2855, distinct from P33. Candida glabrata ileostomy and bloodstream isolates from P39 shared ST 3. P47, who developed can- didaemia by C. parapsilosis, had gastrointestinal colonisation by C. gla- brata. However, the C. glabrata isolated from this individual was ST 2, which was a distinct genotype from P39. In both species for which MLST was possible, sequence type was consistent within a patient over time, but differed between patients.
RAPD fingerprinting with primer Oligo 2 was performed on all cultured Candida isolates that were detected more than once (see Table 1; Figures S2-S4). Four C. albicans isolates generated three dis- tinct RAPD profiles. Candida albicans isolates recovered from the ile- ostomy and bloodstream of P33 had the same RAPD profile A. The bloodstream isolate from P74 gave a distinct RAPD profile B (C. al- bicans was detected in ileostomy samples from P74 but could not be cultured). The common laboratory strain C. albicans SC5314 also gave a distinct pattern C. Nine C. glabrata isolates generated three distinct RAPD profiles. Candida glabrata isolates obtained from the ileostomy and bloodstream of P39 had the same RAPD profile D. Candida gla- brata ileostomy isolates from five consecutive ileostomy samples over a 1 month period in P47 generated RAPD profile E, whereas control strain C. glabrata NRRL Y-65 gave a distinct RAPD pattern F. The RAPD results obtained from C. albicans and C. glabrata isolates are congruent with strain typing data by MLST (Table 1). No RAPD patterns for C. al- bicans or C. glabrata were shared across individuals.
Seven C. parapsilosis isolates generated two distinct RAPD pro- files. Candida parapsilosis isolates from P47 showed distinct RAPD patterns between the ileum and bloodstream. The two C. parapsilosis blood culture isolates were collected from this patient before and after the ileostomy sample was collected. Both blood cultures generated the same RAPD pattern H. However, the ileostomy isolate showed RAPD pattern G. The two ileostomy samples prior to the first blood- stream collection harboured C. parapsilosis, but viable organisms could not be cultured; therefore, RAPD could not be used to identify the
C. parapsilosis to strain. Three C. parapsilosis isolates, collected from the ileum of P62 and the blood of P32 and P74, gave the same RAPD pattern G. Control C. parapsilosis 232, isolated from cheese, also had RAPD pattern G. Since a C. parapsilosis MLST scheme does not exist, primer OPE-04 was also used for RAPD to confirm results obtained by primer Oligo 2. Primer OPE-04 also yielded two distinct patterns among the seven isolates, which agreed with the results from Oligo 2 RAPD (Figure S5).
The chronological carriage of Candida strains is shown in Figure 1. At two points, samples were collected from multiple patients during the same time period. In both cases, patients carried distinct strains from one another. Candida parapsilosis isolates of RAPD profile G were detected consistently over time in four patients. Isolates of all other MLST and RAPD profiles were each restricted to a single patient in the tested samples. No one genotype dominated the patient population.
The antifungal susceptibilities and MICs for the yeast isolates against nine antifungals are shown in Table 2. Candida glabrata isolate 39_B_1 was reported as susceptible dose-dependent to fluconazole (which was administered in a level to patient considered suscepti- ble), intermediate to caspofungin, and resistant to amphotericin B,

Candida albicans, C. orthopsilosis and C. pelliculosa isolates were uni- formly susceptible or susceptible dose dependent (74_B_2 for fluco- nazole) to all antifungals. In addition, we tested one ileal isolate of
C. krusei (from 33_I_3; not shown). This isolate was resistant to flu- conazole, showed an intermediate response to 5-flucytosine, and was susceptible dose-dependent to itraconazole. Isolates showed   a wide range of MICs to fluconazole (0.5-32 mg/mL), as well as mi- cafungin (<0.008-2 mg/mL), anidulafungin (0.015-2 mg/mL) and caspofungin (0.015-2 mg/mL), and a narrow range for 5-flucytosine (<0.06-0.25 mg/mL).

4  |  DISCUSSION 

This study describes SBT recipients who developed fungaemia post- transplant at the UNMC from 2004 to 2007. We employed a variety of techniques to identify and characterise Candida isolates colonising and infecting SBT recipients. This is the first study characterising the fungal intestinal microbiota of SBT recipients. Comprehensive surveys of gut fungi, using next-generation sequencing methods, may report dozens of species or OTUs (operational taxonomic units) from a single faecal sample30; however, the majority of these are rarely detected environmental or dietary fungi that do not appear to colonise the gas- trointestinal tract.31 The fungi we detected from ileostomy samples  in this study are largely those species that do have a well-established association with and role in the gut, especially Candida species.
Prior to 1990, the predominant species causing Candida infections was C. albicans.32 In recent years infections caused by non-albicans species have increased in clinical importance.17 Bloodstream infec- tions in our study were most frequently caused by C. parapsilosis (four cases), whereas C. albicans was isolated in only two infections. Only P47 experienced candidaemia shortly after transplant (at 29 and 35 days, with C. parapsilosis), accordingly, this is the only patient for

whom the 2 week postoperative antifungal prophylaxis with fluco- nazole was anticipated to influence species isolated or susceptibil- ity. One infection each was caused by C. glabrata, C. orthopsilosis and
C. pelliculosa.
Candida pelliculosa is widespread in the environment and in food, and is an opportunistic human and animal pathogen. This yeast tran- siently colonises the oropharyngeal and gastrointestinal tract of humans and it has been implicated in outbreaks in neonatal and paedi- atric intensive care units.33 Candida pelliculosa was not identified in the intestine of P62 from whom it was isolated from the blood. Therefore, it is possible that this patient acquired this species from an exogenous source, as suspected in previous cases.34
We detected previous digestive tract colonisation with Candida in six of the patients with candidaemia. Our findings suggest that at least two bloodstream infections (in P33 and P39) originated from Candida colonising the small bowel, although complete exclusion of environ- mental exposure during hospitalisation is not possible at this time. Closely related isolates in the intestine and blood have been reported in other studies.35,36 Gastrointestinal colonisation is an important source of candidaemia, although only a few studies using molecular typing methods have been reported and sample numbers are small.14 Many studies only report an association between anatomic site of Candida colonisation as a risk factor for subsequent candidaemia and invasive candidiasis in hospitalised and critically ill patients.37,38 However, it is plausible that patients in our study would be infected by endogenous Candida due to the invasive nature of this procedure.
P47 had different strains of C. parapsilosis colonising the intes- tine and infecting the bloodstream, suggesting candidaemia derived from a distinct source. Candida parapsilosis has been reported in the human oral microbiota so endogenous infection remains a possibility. Other possibilities include mutation within the patient and increase in prevalence of a previously undetectable isolate. Nucleotide sequence variation among serial isolates or as separate clones from individual patients is a known phenomenon for strains of C. albicans.39 The ma- jority of documented C. parapsilosis infections are of exogenous origin;

endogenous infections are rarely seen.36 Candida parapsilosis is the most common fungus recovered from the hands and studies have im- plicated health care workers' hands as the source of nosocomial candi- daemia.40 Another possible route of C. parapsilosis transmission could be contaminated parenteral nutrition and intravascular devices.41 Candida parapsilosis was not detected in ileostomy samples from P32 and P74, who developed bloodstream infection with C. parapsilosis. These two individuals could represent further cases of exogenous ac- quisition. In addition to P88, who had no gastrointestinal colonisation with the fungus isolated from the bloodstream, C. orthopsilosis, may have acquired candidaemia exogenously.
P74 was co-infected by two Candida species. Candida parapsilosis was the first organism recovered from the blood, but this was not de- tected in ileostomy samples prior to infection. Candida albicans was present in three ileostomy samples prior to C. albicans detection in the blood. The possibility exists that P74 was infected exogenously by C. parapsilosis and endogenously by the patient's own intestinal
C. albicans. The inability to culture C. albicans from the patient's ileum precluded strain typing and thus confirmation of a possible endoge- nous source.
Studies have documented the ability of Candida isolates to persist in hospital settings and cause temporally associated infections.42,43 In our study, temporal analysis revealed multiple species were responsi- ble for causing bloodstream infections during the study period. At two different time points, samples collected from two patients overlapped, but the patients did not carry the same genotype. However, the same
C. parapsilosis genotype G in four patients was documented at multiple time points. Therefore, there is potential evidence that this C. parapsi- losis strain had a common source. However, environmental sampling would be necessary to confirm or rule out any exogenous source.
Methods used to strain-type Candida species have greatly ad- vanced our knowledge of fungal epidemiology and MLST has been shown to be more discriminating than RAPD for C. albicans.44 In our study, MLST detected distinct sequence types between, but not within, patients. This suggests independent, endogenous acquisition of C. albicans candidaemia, but would need to be confirmed by full genome sequencing. RAPD patterns yielded the same conclusions as MLST for C. albicans and C. glabrata isolates. RAPD fingerprints gener- ated by two independent primers gave the same results for C. parapsi- losis isolates. Other RAPD primers may possibly further differentiate between our isolates; conversely, genetic variation in C. parapsilosis may be minimal. Other methods such as microsatellite markers may be more discriminatory for epidemiological investigations of C. parapsilo- sis,45 but ultimately future work will have to encompass full genome sequence of well-documented, larger collections.
There is increasing concern regarding antifungal resistance in Candida, especially C. parapsilosis. In our study, two C. parapsilosis isolates from the same patient showed resistance to amphotericin
In addition, the one isolate of C. glabrata also showed resistance to amphotericin B using the in vitro microplate susceptibility testing method. Although resistance of Candida species to amphotericin B is rare, the frequency of resistance to amphotericin B has been shown to be highest with C. parapsilosis (2.5%) followed by C. krusei (2.0%)

and C. glabrata (0.8%).46 Interestingly also, the formation of biofilms in
parapsilosis did lead to a significant (P = .0004) lowering of activity for amphotericin B from 100% susceptible to 32.1% susceptible in this species.47 However, there are no standardised methods available to perform and interpret in vitro amphotericin B susceptibility testing.26 Candida albicans isolates from this study were susceptible to all anti- fungal agents. The C. glabrata strain causing candidaemia in addition to amphotericin B was also resistant to itraconazole and posacon- azole, intermediate to caspofungin and susceptible dose-dependent to fluconazole. This strain was also detected in the patient's ileal fluid 4 months prior to infection. One other patient harboured C. glabrata in the ileum, but was only infected by C. parapsilosis. The one C. krusei isolate we obtained in culture showed some level of drug resistance, notably to fluconazole; however, no C. krusei strain in this study was implicated in candidaemia. All patients were exposed to fluconazole prophylaxis in the immediate perioperative period.
One limitation of this study was the inability to culture viable or- ganisms from several ileostomy samples. Thus, while we know an il- eostomy sample harboured a specific species, intestinal origin could not be confirmed due to the inability to strain-type. Techniques to strain-type species in mixed matrices need to be developed to avoid requiring pure cultures of isolates. Another limitation was the inability to determine whether ileal Candida originated in the donor or recipient bowel. Donor-derived Candida infections have been documented in kidney transplant recipients.48 To date, no efforts have been made to identify Candida species and/or strains from the donor small bowel, or from other sources of recipient microbiota, to investigate the origin of candidaemia in SBT recipients.
These findings highlight the possibility of hospitalised SBT patients acquiring candidaemia both endogenously and exogenously, although the exact route of infection in these transplant patients is not clear. Knowing the source of Candida implicated in infection (recipient, donor or hospital acquired) will inform pretransplant interventions and treatments to improve outcomes for SBT patients. Future efforts should include collection and culturing of donor and recipient sam- ples (including oral, colon and skin microbiota) prior to transplant, as well as continuing ileostomy sample collection throughout hospitalisa- tion. This would highlight the role (if any) of the donor microbiota and may direct prevention efforts. Targeted interventions could reduce exogenous and endogenous infections, and environmental sampling may reveal sources of infection and solutions. Reducing endogenous recipient-derived infection by means of existing prophylactics will be more difficult and will require innovative interventions.
