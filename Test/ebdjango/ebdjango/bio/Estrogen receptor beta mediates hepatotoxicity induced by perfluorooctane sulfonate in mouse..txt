Abstract Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), an artificial fluorosurfactant and global contaminant, is used widely in various consumer products. In this study, we investigated the function of estrogen receptor b (ERb) in PFOS-induced bile acid and cholesterol metabolism disorders and gut microbiome using ERb knockout mice that were exposed to PFOS by gavage. Our results showed that a daily dose of 5 mg PFOS/kg significantly induced hydropic degeneration and vacuolation in hepatic cells, reduced bile acid, and cholesterol levels in liver tissue, and influenced the abundance and com- position of gut microbiota. Notably, ERb deficiency not only ameliorated morphological alterations of hepatocytes but also relieved disorders in bile acids and cholesterol metabolism caused by PFOS. Furthermore, the changes in the gut microbiome by PFOS were also modulated. The relative tran- script abundance of key genes involved in bile acid and cho- lesterol metabolism exhibited similar changes. In HepG2

cells, PFOS increased ERb expression, which could be blocked by adding PHTPP (a selective antagonist of ERb). Our study thus provides new evidence that ERb mediates PFOS-induced hepatotoxicity.

Introduction

Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances are extremely stable surfactants that have been used widely in industrial production and daily life since the 1950s (Buck et al. ). Of their various family members, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS; C8F17SO -) can be degraded or metabolized from perfluorooctanesulfonyl fluoride-based compounds (Chang et al. ).
In recent years, PFOS is widely distributed and universally

 		detected in humans (Harada et al. ; Ingelido et al. ;

Kato et al. ; Zhang et al. ), but considerable epide- miological and animal researches suggested that PFOS had adverse health effects, such as disturbances in lipid metabo- lism (Wang et al. ), neurotoxicity (Mariussen ), immunotoxicity (Dong et al. ), pulmonary disease (Humblet et al. ), reproductive toxicity (Lopez-Doval et al. ), and prostate cancer (Eriksen et al. ). Thus, PFOS was one of nine new persistent organic pollutants to be outlawed in the 2009 Stockholm Convention. Recent studies have also reported that PFOS potentially disrupts endo- crine function in vitro and in vivo (Cheng et al. ;      Du et al. ). In addition, Kjeldsen et al. found that PFOS enhanced ER transactivity in vitro (Kjeldsen and Bonefeld-Jorgensen ).


Estrogen receptors (ERs) are members of the nuclear re- ceptor family and mediate many processes in humans. The initial role of ER in association with reproductive function/ processes has been studied by researchers. Thereafter, their roles in many human physiological processes have also attracted more attention by researchers, such as in cardiovas- cular function, regulating vascular function, blood pressure, endothelial relaxation, and the development of hypertrophy and cardio-protection (Menazza and Murphy ); in bone tissue, maintaining bone mineral density (Khalid and Krum ); in the central nervous system, regulating memory and maintenance of hippocampal function (Bean et al. ); and in hematopoiesis, regulating the differentiation of pluripotent hematopoietic progenitor cells (Shim et al. ). The two predominant ERs are estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) and es- trogen receptor beta (ERb), which respond to 17 beta- estradiol in their natural signaling pathways (Nilsson and Gustafsson ). ERa is the primary ER isoform in hepato- cytes (Gao et al. ), and several studies with knockout mice indicated that ERa played a role in hepatic lipid metab- olism. Recently, Foryst-Ludwig et al. () confirmed that ERb played a role in the liver of mammals. However, only few studies focused on the role of the function of ERb in liver homeostasis.
PFOS has potential estrogenic effects. In this study, we first determined whether PFOS influenced hepatic ER expression in mice. Then, we measured the effects of 28 days of gavage with 5 mg PFOS/(kg/day) on hepatic bile acid and cholesterol metabolism and the gut microbiota in male mice. We chose the dose of 5 mg/kg/day according to previous reports which is a moderate dose inducing defects in mice health. The role of ERb in mediating hepatotoxicity of PFOS was also described for the first time.


Materials and methods

Chemicals, animals, and diets

PFOS (CAS No. 2795-39-3, purity >98%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), and 4-(2-phenyl-5,7- bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-3-yl)phenol and 2-phenyl-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5,7-bis (trifluoromethyl)- pyrazolo [1,5-alpha]pyrimidine (PHTPP, CAS 805239-56-9) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).
ERb knockout (ERbKO) mice were generated as de- scribed (Krege et al. ). The ERb KO (B6.129P2- Esr2tm1Unc/J)  mice  were  purchased  from  The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Males and females heterozy- gous for the ERb allele (ERb-/+) were intercrossed. Genotyping using DNA  isolated from mouse tails was per- formed by PCR analysis. Mice homozygous for the non-


functional ERb allele (ERb-/-) producing no ERb protein and their wild-type littermates (ERb+/+) were used in the study. Male wild-type (WT) and ERbKO mice, aged 12- 14 weeks, were divided randomly into four groups (groups A and C, WT mice; groups B and D, ERb KO mice; n = 8 mice/group).
PFOS was dissolved in 0.5% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich) and given daily by oral gavage to mice for 28 days at 0 mg/kg (groups A and B) and 5 mg/kg (groups C and D). The mice were housed individually in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) barrier at the Animal Core Facility of Nanjing Medical University at 22.5 +- 2.5 degC and 30 to 70% humidity on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle.
All animal procedures were conducted per the local Animal Care and Use Committee of Nanjing Medical University. On day 29, the mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation fol- lowing CO2 anesthesia. Then, blood was collected by retro- orbital puncture and stored at -20 degC. Additional liver tissue was separated into freezer tubes and stored at -70 degC.

Cell culture and experiments

The immortalized cell line HepG2 was purchased from ATCC (HB-8065, Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured at 37 degC, 5% CO2, with Dulbecco's modified eagle medium, containing 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). When the cell confluency reached 50%, PFOS was added and incubated for 24 h. Cells were plated on 6-well plates and administrated with two different concentrations (0, 10 and 10 mmol/L) of PFOS for 24 h. In the reverse experiment, we pretreated the HepG2 cells  with    1 mmol/L PHTPP for 30 min before treatment with PFOS. Cells were washed with PBS twice and  extracted  pro-  tein with protein lysis buffer. Each assay was repeated three times.

Histopathological examination

Liver tissues were placed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and kept for at least 24 h. Livers were embedded and complete horizontal sections (sectioned at 5 mm) were made. Multiple slides of each liver were prepared as standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained glass slides for microscopic evaluation (x400). In each group, we observed 50 fields. To quantify the histological alterations, we scored each group's liver tissues according to previous study (Kleiner et al. ).

Analysis of hepatic bile acids and total cholesterol

One hundred milligrams of frozen liver tissue was homoge- nized with 900 mL 0.9% NaCl solution. After centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 10 min at 4 degC, the supernatant was collected.



Hepatic total cholesterol and bile acid content were measured with an enzymatic kit (cholesterol: E003, and bile acid: A111- 2, NJJCBIO, Nanjing, China) per the manufacturer's instruc- tions. An aliquot of 10 mL supernatant, standard sample, and distilled water as blank were incubated with 1 mL reaction reagent (containing Good's buffer solution 50 mmol/L, phenol 5 mmol/L, 4-APP 0.3 mmol/L, cholesterol esterase 50 KU/L, cholesterol oxidase 25 KU/L, peroxidase 1.3 KU/L) at 37 degC for 10 min, respectively. The absorbance of the reaction solu- tion was thereafter determined at 510 nm wavelength to mea- sure the O.D. value with a spectrophotometer. Hepatic choles- terol content was calculated with the following formula: (O.D. sample - O.D. blank) / (O.D. standard substance - O.D. blank) * (concentration of standard substance) / (liver weight) (mmol/g liver).
For bile acid measurement, another 30 mL of the supernatant, standard sample, and distilled water were incubated with 240 mL of reagent A (containing phosphate buffer solution PH = 7.5,100 mmol/L, diaphorase 1000 U/L, nicotinamide ade- nine dinucleotide cofactor 1 mmol/L, pyruvic acid 50 mmol/L, iodonitrotetrazolium 0.5 mmol/L), respectively,  at 37 degC for 5 min, and then an O.D. value of 1 at 505 nm of wavelength was detected with a spectrophotometer. Afterwards, 60 mL re- agent B ( containing phosphate buffer  solution pH = 7.5,100 mmol/L, 3a-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2000 U/L) was added and incubated at 37 degC for 5 min, and an
O.D. value of 2 at 505 nm wavelength was detected with a spectrophotometer. The concentration of bile acid was calculated with the following formula: ((sample (O.D. 2 - O.D. 1) / standard substance (O.D.2 - O.D.1) * (concentration of standard sub- stance) (mmol/g liver).

Western blot

Total proteins that were extracted from liver tissue (80 mg) and HepG2 cells (50 mg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 90 V for 90 min. A total of 5% skimmed milk was used to block the membrane. Then, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies for ERa (Abcam, ab76228, 1:1000), ERb (Abcam, ab3576, 1:1000), and GAPDH (Beyotime, AG019, 1:1000) overnight at 4 degC. The immunoreactive bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) western blotting detection reagents (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Image Lab software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, US) was used to quantify the band density. Protein expression levels were normalized to GAPDH levels.

RNA extraction and real-time PCR

Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol according to the man- ufacturer's protocol. RNA concentration was measured on a

NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo), and complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized per the manufacturer (PrimeScript(r) RT Master Mix, TaKaRa Code: DRR036A Takara Bio, Tokyo, Japan). Levels of the target genes were quantified on an ABI PRISM 7900HT (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). PCR was carried out in a 20-mL reac- tion, containing 0.4 mL cDNA, 2.5 mL 2x SYBR(r) Premix Ex Taq II, 0.1 mL 50x ROX Reference Dye II (Takara Bio, Tokyo, Japan), and 0.4 mmol/L of each primer set. The se- quences of the target gene primers are listed in Supplementary Table 1. The PCR  program  was  as  follows:  95  degC  for 30 s and 40 cycles of 95 degC for 5 s and 60 degC for 30 s.  Each PCR reaction was performed in triplicate. The data were analyzed using ABI PRISM SDS  2.2.2  software.  The mean Ct values were used as the final Ct values. Relative expression levels were calculated using the 2-DDCt (threshold  cycle) method with cyclophilin  as the internal standard.


Metagenome sequencing

On day 29, the feces of mice in the four groups were collected from each cage and stored immediately at -80 degC. The DNA from each feces samples (n = 3/group) was extracted with Qiagen QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit. The details of the metagenome sequencing and biological data analysis were previously described (Xu et al. ; Yan et al. ). Briefly, the 515F (5'-barcode-GTG CCAGCMGCCGCGG- 3') and 907R (5'-CCGTCAATTCMTTTRAGT TT-3')
primers were used to amplify the V4-V5 region of the bacte- rial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. After purifying the amplicons, we performed Illumina MiSeq sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform in the Teagasc sequencing facility, using a 2 x 300 cycle V3 kit, following standard Illumina sequencing protocols. UPARSE (version 7.1 ) was used to cluster them into operational taxonomic units (OTUs), using a 97% similarity cutoff.


Statistical analysis

Statistical data were represented as means +- standard error. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to examine the normality of data. Then, the variable with normal distributions was analyzed by unpaired Student's two-tailed t test between two groups and the ANOVA test with multiple comparison post hoc test among three groups or more than three groups. The variables with non-normal distributions were analyzed by Kruskal- Wallis test with adjustments for multiple comparisons. A dif- ference was considered statistically significant if P < 0.05. The software Statistical Package for Social Sciences 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used.



Results

Effects of PFOS on ER expression

Exposure of 5 mg/kg PFOS to male mice induced ERb pro- tein, but no effects on the expression of ERa protein was observed (Fig. ). Therefore, we used ERb knockout mice in the following experiments to determine whether PFOS in- fluences murine liver metabolism through ERb.


Pathological alterations in liver caused by PFOS

Exposure to PFOS led to hydropic degeneration and vacuola- tion in hepatocytes, as shown in the H&E-stained section of liver tissue (Fig. ). In contrast, in the ERb knockout group, no significant pathological changes were observed, even at the same dose of PFOS. The score is presented in Fig. .


Effects of PFOS on cholesterol and bile acid metabolism

Hepatic cholesterol and bile acid levels in male WT mice exposed to PFOS were significantly lower than in the control group (Fig. , d) (P < 0.001 and P = 0.007). Notably, in ERb knockout mice, the same dose of PFOS did not change hepatic total cholesterol or bile acid levels.

Expression of genes involved in cholesterol and bile acid metabolism in liver and intestine

The liver and intestine are the key organs that regulate   bile acid and cholesterol metabolism.  We did  not  find any differences in cholesterol synthesis, as evidenced by the similar levels of the rate-limiting enzyme 3-hydroxy- 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (Hmgcr) (Fig. 3a). The high-density lipoprotein receptor  scaven- ger receptor B type I (Srbi and low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr) did not change between groups (Fig. 3b), either.
The canalicular cholesterol transporter ATP-binding cassette (ABC) g5  increased  approximately  3-fold (P < 0.001) only in the  PFOS-treated  groups  (Fig. 3d). We did not observe any differences in intestinal NPC1L1, a key gene that mediates intestinal cholesterol absorption (Fig. 3f). The messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of other related genes (Srbi and Abca1) were unaltered (Fig. 3c, e).
Cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) is an important en- zyme for bile acid synthesis in the liver. Its mRNA levels decreased by approximately 50% (P < 0.001) only in PFOS- treated mice (Fig. 3g). Fgf15 is secreted by enterocytes in the ileum and negatively regulates hepatic Cyp7a1 expression. Its expression increased 15-fold in the intestine (P < 0.001) (Fig. 3h).

PFOS decreases the abundance of gut microbiota

Bile acids are subjected to the enterohepatic cycle several times per day. Entering the intestine, they are modified by gut microbiome through de-conjugation to free bile acids and 7-dehydroxylation of primary bile acids into secondary bile acids, therefore modulating the composition of bile acids

as well. Compared with the control group, the overall abun- dance of bacteria decreased significantly (by 5.7%) in PFOS- treated mice, while no noticeable difference occurred in the ERb knockout group (Table ). We also investigated commu- nity richness (e.g., the ACE and Chao1 estimators) and com- munity diversity (e.g., the Shannon and Simpson indices), based on the OTUs in the four groups (Table ). Similarly,

respectively, by oral gavage for 4 weeks. Values are expressed as mean +- S.D. (n = 8 in each group).***P value <0.001 compared with the control group



the ACE and Chao indices in PFOS-exposed animals appeared to be reduced when compared with the control mice, although no significant differences were present in the study.

ERb deficiency attenuates PFOS-induced alterations in gut microbiome composition

By principal component analysis (PCA) with weighted UniFrac analysis, we noted significant differences be- tween the composition of the gut microbiome in PFOS- exposed and control mice. Notably, ERb deficiency al- tered the PFOS-mediated effects on the categorization of the composition of the gut microbiome (Fig. ). The hier- archical heat map (Supplemental Fig. 1) was based on the 55 most abundant bacterial communities at the family level.

PFOS induced ERb in HepG2 cells

When HepG2 cells were incubated with PFOS alone, ERb was induced at 10 mol/L and, to a lesser extent, 100 mol/L. However, this effect was blocked when they were preincubat- ed with PHTPP, as shown in Fig. .


Discussion

Various doses of PFOS (0.005 to 20  mg/kg/day)  have been applied in mouse studies to evaluate its toxic effects (Dong et al. ; Fuentes et al. ; Qazi et al. ; Wan et al. ; Wang et al.  ). However,  few  stud- ies have investigated the effects of PFOS on hepatic cho- lesterol and bile acid metabolism. In addition to the pre- vious findings, our results provide evidence of the toxic effect of PFOS on hepatic metabolism of cholesterol and bile acids and its influence on gut microbiota, suggesting that changes in hepatic cholesterol and bile acid metabo- lism and the gut microbiota are useful markers for mon- itoring  the effect after being exposed to PFOS. Notably,    at the same doses of PFOS, the alterations in cholesterol and bile acid metabolism and gut microbiota 

were mitigated in ERb knockout mice, indicating that  ERb in part mediates PFOS-induced hepatotoxicity and changes in gut microbiome.
PFOS can cause hepatotoxicity through such processes as apoptosis (Kim et al. ), hepatomegaly, and peroxisome proliferation (Berthiaume and Wallace ). However, the underlying mechanism of these events has not been deter- mined. Wan found that PFOS altered glutathione S- transferase pi (GSTP) gene methylation patterns and induced liver toxicity (Wan et al. ). Independent studies by Kim and Wan showed that PFOS caused hepatotoxicity by disrupting lipid metabolism (Kim et al. ; Wan et al. ). Epidemiological studies also revealed that PFOS mod- ifies the transcript levels of genes involved with cholesterol mobilization (Fletcher et al. ). Previous research focused primarily on serum cholesterol concentrations (Lau et al. ; Seacat et al. ).
In this study, we measured cholesterol levels in liver, where most cholesterol is metabolized, and found disturbances in hepatic bile acid and cholesterol metabolism in mice. Cyp7a1 is the rate-limiting enzyme of bile acid synthesis through the hydroxylation of cholesterol (Hylemon et al. ) and mediates cholesterol homeostasis. Our data dem- onstrated a decrease in Cyp7a1 expression, which led to lower hepatic bile acid levels in PFOS-treated mice. Fgf15 is secret- ed in the terminal ileum and participates in the negative feed- back of hepatic bile acid synthesis by binding to FGF receptor 4 in hepatocytes (Inagaki et al. ). Notably, Fgf15 expres- sion was elevated in the intestine only in the PFOS-exposed group, which might account for the disorder in bile acid syn- thesis in these mice.
Abcg5 and Abcg8 constitute the obligate heterodimeric transporter for canalicular cholesterol transport in hepatocytes, regulating cholesterol levels in the liver and bile (Baldan et al. ). The increase in Abcg5 expression suggested greater excretion of hepatic cholesterol into bile which is likely to have accounted for the low cholesterol levels in liver tissue. Neither the key genes that are involved in cholesterol synthe- sis nor the hepatic lipoprotein receptors Srbi or Ldlr differed between groups in this study. These data suggested that lower hepatic cholesterol level was not due to defects in cholesterol synthesis or absorption in hepatocytes after PFOS exposure.

Another highlight in this study is to discover whether the estrogen receptor is involved with mediating liver toxicity of PFOS. PFOS was previously reported to interfere with nuclear hormone receptors (Du et al. ). ER transactivation test indicated that PFOS had weak estrogenic activity (Kjeldsen and Bonefeld-Jorgensen ). However, only one study in zebrafish showed that PFOS upregulated ERb mRNAwithout altering ERa or ERg (Fang et al. ). Our present study showed that PFOS influenced the expression of ERb but not ERa in the liver. In addition, ERb might be involved in me- diating the perturbance of bile acids and cholesterol metabo- lism in PFOS-exposed mice, because a lack of ERb rescued these impairments.
We also observed alterations in the abundance and composition of the gut microbiome after PFOS exposure  in mice. The gut microbiota is seen as a "superorganism"

since they encode important genes for metabolic process- es such as digesting dietary fibers,  metabolizing  drugs  and chemicals, and producing  vitamins  (Arumugam et al. ; Pennisi ). On exposure to hazardous chemicals, the gut microbiome might be disturbed resulting in an increased health risk in the host (Snedeker and Hay ). Changes of gut  microbiota have been reported to contribute to the development of diseases such as atherosclerosis (Org et al. ), obesity (Miele et al. ), and diabetes (Tai et al. ). The products of gut microbiota such as short-chain fatty acids could modulate energy harvest and fat partitioning (Goffredo et al. ). Gut microbiota may affect chem- ical metabolism via direct activation of chemicals, deple- tion of metabolites needed for biotransformation, alter- ation of host biotransformation enzyme activities, chang-  es in enterohepatic circulation, altered bioavailability of environmental chemicals and/or antioxidants from food, and alterations in gut motility and barrier function. Previous studies using conventional and germ-free mice demonstrated that cholesterol  metabolism  is  modulated by gut microbiota (Rabot et al. ). The hepatic  bile  acid synthesis is sophisticatedly regulated by the process- es as hepatic synthesis secretion, ileal reabsorption, and modification of bile acid composition by gut microbiome, as well as feedback regulation through nuclear receptors such as farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-SHP pathway and hormonal regulation by ileal FGF15, etc. (Chiang ). The gut microbiome plays key roles in hydrolyz-  ing conjugated bile acids and 7alpha-dehydroxlating pri- mary bile acid into secondary bile acid, modifying the composition and pool of bile acids (Degirolamo et al.  ; Fiorucci and Distrutti  ;  Joyce  et  al.  ). As shown by Sayin et al., gut microbiota not only regu- lated secondary bile acid metabolism but also 



inhibited bile acid synthesis in the liver by alleviating  FXR inhibition in the ileum (Sayin et al. ). In addi- tion, the enterohepatic circulation in vertebrates alters the gut microbiome, resulting in abnormal bile acid and cho- lesterol homeostasis. But no research has focused on the effects of PFOS on gut microbiota.
We have found that the abundance and composition of the gut microbiome altered after exposure to PFOS. Few studies have reported the relationship between ERs and the gut microbiome, one of which has suggested that gut microbiota-derived metabolites regulate ER activity (Dellafiora et al. ). In our study, ERb deficiency reversed the changes in the gut microbiome.


Conclusion

Deletion of ERb alleviates the disturbances in bile acid and cholesterol metabolism that are caused by PFOS. The abun- dance and composition of the gut microbiome also change after PFOS exposure. Our results indicate that the gut microbiome is one of the primary targets of PFOS-induced hepatotoxicity. These findings increase our understanding of the adverse effects of PFOS on gut microbiome as well as bile acid and cholesterol metabolism.
