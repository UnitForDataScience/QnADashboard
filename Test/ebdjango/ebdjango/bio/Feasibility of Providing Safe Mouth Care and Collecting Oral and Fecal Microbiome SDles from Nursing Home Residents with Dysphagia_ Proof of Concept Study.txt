ABSTRACT
Individuals with dysphagia who re- side in nursing homes often receive inadequate mouth care and experi- ence poor oral health. From a poli- cy perspective, the combination of absent evidence-based mouth care protocols coupled with insufficient dental coverage create a pool of in- dividuals at great risk for prevent- able infectious illnesses that con- tribute to high health care costs. The purpose of the current study was to determine (a) the safety of a mouth care protocol tailored for individuals with dysphagia residing in nursing homes without access to suction equipment, and (b) the fea- sibility of collecting oral and fecal samples for microbiota analyses. The mouth care protocol resulted in improved oral hygiene with-  out aspiration, and oral and fecal samples were safely collected from participants. Policies supporting ongoing testing of evidence-based mouth care protocols for individu- als with dysphagia are important to improve quality, demonstrate efficacy, and save health care costs.

f 1.4 million individuals resid- ing in nursing homes, 40% to
60% have some form of dysphagia or swallowing problems (Morley, 2015). These individuals often have poor oral hygiene with associated gingivitis and periodontal disease (Ortega et al., 2014), most likely because mouth care is either omit- ted due to concerns about aspiration (Eisenstadt, 2010) or provided with sponge brushes with chemical anti- plaque agents instead of soft tooth- brushes (Maeda & Akagi, 2014).
These sponge brushes are inad- equate for plaque removal (Booker, Murff, Kitko, & Jablonski, 2013).
Excellent oral hygiene is impor- tant for this population because of inadequate access to dental services and high levels of untreated den- tal decay and periodontal diseases (National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, 2017). One publication from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) noted that  nurs-
ing home care residents overall have extremely limited access to routine dental services because of several factors: Medicare's general lack of coverage for dental services; unwill- ingness of dentists to provide care in these facilities; and underestimation of dental care needs by long-term care staff (IOM & National Re- search Council, 2011). Beneficiaries may opt to purchase dental care through a Medicare Advantage plan (Medicare Part C), but must pay
the Part B premium and additional Part C premium (Medicare, 2017). Medicaid, which provides coverage for 16 million older and disabled adults (21% of whom also receive Medicare), considers dental care
an "optional" service provided at the discretion of individual states (Paradise, 2015). Fifteen states pro- vide extensive benefits whereas the remaining provide limited benefits (n = 19), emergency-only benefits (n = 13), or no benefits (n = 4) (Hinton & Paradise, 2016). The current study was conducted in the

only state (Alabama) that provides no adult dental services through Medicare or Medicaid, regardless of other health conditions or access to care. Older adults who have limited or extensive benefits are further hampered by unaffordable copay- ments, confusion regarding specific covered services, and shortages of providers who accept Medicaid (Northridge et al., 2017).
Recommendations from re- searchers and clinicians regarding mouth care for individuals with swallowing disorders include removing pocketed  food  manu- ally (by hand) (Dyck, Bertone, Knutson, & Campbell, 2012), using prescribed mouth rinses contain- ing chlorhexidine (Chipps et al., 2014; Dyck et al., 2012), and "being careful" (Halton Region Health Department, 2008). A Cochrane review reported only two trials involving a small number of stroke survivors with swallowing disor- ders. Although the interventions improved the knowledge of nurses, the interventions did not translate into improved dental cleanliness (Brady, Furlanetto, Hunter, Lewis, & Milne, 2006). Mouth care in this population is vital because of their increased risk for aspiration pneu- monia, periodontal disease and as-
sociated tooth loss, dental caries and related odontogenic (tooth-related) pain, and poor nutrition resulting from impaired dentition (Maeda & Akagi, 2014; Ortega et al., 2014).
Given the lack of evidence-based guidelines for oral care procedures in this population (Chan,  Lee, Poh, Ng, & Prabhakaran, 2011; Chipps et al., 2014), there is a need for an evidence-based mouth care protocol specific for individuals with dysphagia that meets the fol- lowing criteria: (a) presents a low risk for aspiration, (b) promotes
a healthy oral microbiome, and
demonstrates ecological valid- ity for implementation in nursing homes.

MOUTH CARE, ORAL
MICROBIOTA, AND SYSTEMIC INFECTIONS
The relationship between poor oral health and systemic infections, such as pneumonia, are well docu- mented (Takeshita et al., 2010; van der Maarel-Wierink, Vanobbergen, Bronkhorst, Schols, & de Baat, 2013). Pneumonia is an expen-
sive infection; it costs Medicare
$19.6 million dollars annually (Wier & Andrews, 2011) and remains one of the top five reasons for prevent- able hospitalizations (Segal, 2011). The simple act of providing daily mouth care has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of pneumo- nia in individuals with dysphagia (Scannapieco, Bush, & Paju, 2003). There is also emerging evidence that poor oral health may alter the com- position of gut microbiota (Hajish- engallis & Lamont, 2012; McLean, 2014), in turn predisposing the host to Clostridium difficile infections (Bien, Palagani, & Bozko, 2013).
However, the focus in research to date has been on individual bacterial pathogens colonizing dental plaque as culprits for systemic illnesses, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia (El-Solh, 2011; Leibovitz et al., 2003; Ortega et al., 2015; Takeshita et al., 2010; van der Maarel-Wierink et al., 2013). Devel- oping data about the oral microbi- ome, especially with the deluge of data available with next-generation sequencing capabilities and bioin- formatics gains, are changing the understanding of the oral-systemic link. Ninety percent of cells found  in the human body are from a com- mensal community of microbes
that interact with the host cells to assist with the biological functions of digestion and protection (immu- nity) (Shoemark & Allen, 2015). The oral microbiome consists of genes
of microorganisms residing in the human oral cavity (Chen & Jiang, 2014). Bacteria and archaea are the most predominant members of the

microflora (Wade, 2013). Members of the oral microflora support im- munity by preventing  adherence of exogenous organisms to oral cavity structures or actively killing
pathogens by secreting toxins (Scan- napieco, 2013). Although variation is high among individuals, the most











common microbes encountered in healthy mouths include members of the genera Streptococcus, Prevotella, Neisseria, Haemophilus, Porphy- romonas, Gemella, Rothia, Granuli- catella, Fusobacterium, Actinomyces, and Veillonella (Chen & Jiang, 2014).
Lack of mouth care over time causes accumulation and calcifica- tion of dental plaque. This accumu- lation favors dysbiosis. Dysbiosis is an imbalance among the microbes, which results in shifting composi- tions of microbial communities that favor the growth of antagonistic groups of microbes (Kholy, Genco, & Van Dyke, 2015). The "Poly- microbial Synergy and Dysbiosis" hypothesis postulates that oral disease is caused not by individual pathogens but by the entire dysbiot- ic microbial community working in concert (Hajishengallis & Lamont, 2012). For example, higher propor- tions of the genera Prevotella and Veillonella and lower proportions
of Neisseria and Haemophilus have been observed in the oral micro- biota of individuals with periodon- tal disease (Takeshita et al., 2014). Periodontal disease progression requires the presence of transitional bacterial complexes that shift the

subgingival environment from an aerobic environment that promotes commensal bacteria to an anaerobic environment that promotes peri- odontal pathogens (Divaris et al., 2012; Haffajee, Socransky, Patel, & Song, 2008). As periodontal disease progresses in severity, the diversity











of other genera, such as Selenomo- nas, Eubacterium, and Dialister, increase (Olson et al., 2011). The dysbiotic process is further  abet- ted by issues specific to individu-  als with dysphagia: retained food particles in the oral cavity, especially "pocketing" between the cheek and gums, and reduced saliva produc- tion. Saliva production is hampered by many of the medications taken by older adults in general, but is additionally exacerbated by the
lack of fluids provided orally to individuals with severe dyspha- gia who receive all nourishment from a gastric tube. Nursing home
residents with milder dysphagia are often prescribed thickened liquids; these liquids are thickened with cornstarch or arrowroot and are unpleasant to drink, contributing to dehydration and reduced saliva production. Regardless of etiology,
dysbiosis ultimately results in higher bacterial loads and may result in an inflammation-mediated migration
of microbes and microbial byprod- ucts through the ulcerated gingival tissues of the periodontal pocket to other sites, such as the lungs and
heart valves with the performance of daily oral activities, including chew- ing, oral hygiene, and manipulation

of oral tissues (Shoemark & Allen, 2015; Tomas, Diz, Tobias, Scully, & Donos, 2012). Dysbiosis in the oral cavity may trigger a "domino" effect that results in dysbiosis throughout the entire alimentary canal (van
der Putten, De Visschere, van der Maarel-Wierink, Vanobbergen, & Schols, 2013). Chronic and recurring infections and inflammatory dis- eases, such as pneumonia, C. difficile infections, and inflammatory bowel disease, may result from dysbiosis throughout the entire alimentary canal (Bien et al., 2013; Ortega et al., 2015).
Published mouth care protocols for clinicians of any type that have been tested exclusively with nursing home residents who have swallow- ing disorders do not seem to exist, despite the volume of research showing correlations between aspiration pneumonia and poor oral health in this population (Eisenstadt, 2010; Pace & McCullough, 2010).
The nursing home environment also presents challenges for providing mouth care to those at risk for aspi- ration: suction equipment is rarely readily available (Costello & Coyne, 2008). In hospitals, nurses routinely provide mouth care to patients un- able to swallow using toothbrushes connected to wall suction. The use of suction minimizes aspiration of the oral contents or products used in mouth care. Thus, the purposes of the current proof of concept study were: (a) to determine the safety of
a mouth care protocol tailored for individuals with dysphagia residing in nursing homes without access to suction equipment; and (b) to deter- mine the feasibility of collecting oral and fecal samples for microbiota analyses. This article provides the first step in developing an evidence- based mouth care protocol for nurs- ing home residents with dysphagia and policy implications by explor- ing the feasibility of delivering said protocol and conducting  related data collection activities (oral and fecal samples for microbiome analy-

ses). With evidence, policies could be developed to cover costs of oral care that benefit nursing home resi- dents, improve health and nutrition, reduce discomfort, and save expen- ditures by reducing complications.

METHOD
The method used for the current study was descriptive. To be in- cluded in the study, participants had to have a documented diagnosis of dysphagia in their medical record or require thickened liquids or receive nutrition through a feeding tube.
Individuals receiving thickened liq- uids or tube feedings have received a diagnosis of dysphagia in the past, but depending on the length of stay in the nursing home, the dysphagia diagnosis may no longer be docu- mented in available medical records. Other inclusion criteria were age 65 or older, documented diagnosis of any dementia, and dependence on others for mouth care. These criteria were selected because they increase the likelihood of having poor oral hygiene. Because the purpose of the study involved a mouth care proto- col, participants had to have at least two adjacent teeth.

Instruments and Measures
The Oral Health  Assessment Tool (OHAT) is a modification of the Brief Oral Health Status Exami- nation (Kayser-Jones, Bird, Paul, Long, & Schell, 1995), an oral health instrument developed specifically for long-term care residents with moderate to severe dementia and with demonstrated reliability and validity (Chalmers, King, Spencer, Wright, & Carter, 2005). Each of the OHAT's eight categories is perti- nent to specific oral structures and is scored from 0 (healthy) to 2 (un- healthy), resulting in scores rang- ing from 0 to 16, with lower scores indicating better oral health.
The Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (Katz ADL) assesses overall performance

in six areas of self-care: bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, continence, and feeding (Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jackson, & Jaffe, 1963). A score of 1 (completely dependent), 2 (requires assistance) or 3 (complete- ly independent) is assigned for each of the six areas, with scores ranging from 6 (completely dependent) to 18 (completely independent).





















The Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) was used to quantify de- mentia severity by placing it in one of seven stages: (a) no cognitive decline, normal; (b) very mild cogni- tive decline, forgetfulness; (c) mild cognitive decline, early confusional;
moderate cognitive decline, late confusional; (e) moderately severe decline, early dementia; (f) severe cognitive decline, middle dementia; and (g) very severe cognitive decline, late dementia (Reisberg, Ferris, De Leon, & Crook, 1982).
Supragingival plaque samples were chosen to represent the oral cavity microbiome (microbiota abundance). Supragingival plaque has the highest concentration of operational taxonomic units, reflect-

ing changes in richness and diversity that may occur with consistent oral hygiene (Chen & Jiang, 2014; Xu
et al., 2015; Zaura, Keijser, Huse,
& Crielaard, 2009). Gut microbiota were obtained using fecal samples.

Procedure
Institutional review board ap- proval was obtained from the Uni- versity of Alabama at Birmingham prior to the initiation of the study. Consent was obtained from the legally authorized representatives of the participants. Baseline data were obtained regarding oral health (OHAT), functional status (Katz ADL), and severity of dementia (GDS). Before the implementation of the mouth care protocol, a mem- ber of the research team obtained supragingival plaque samples by swabbing the buccal and lingual gingival margins using a sterile ap- plicator. Another member of the research team swabbed the anus
of the nursing home resident for residual fecal material. Each swab was returned to its container and a label with the unique identification number and location was affixed to the outer package. The swabs were placed in a zip-lock bag and placed into a cooler, under a frozen gel pack. Once data collection was com- pleted, the specimens were taken
to the laboratory for analysis. This process was also repeated after the last incidence of mouth care.

Description of Mouth Care Protocol for Individuals With Dysphagia
Mouth care was  provided twice daily for 5 days and once on
Day 6. Oxygenation saturation was recorded prior to mouth care using a disposable pulse oximeter placed on the index finger of the right or left hand. The oral cavity was first assessed using a penlight; pocketed food and other debris were removed using a dry, soft toothbrush. The resident was asked to lean forward during this step. A second tooth-

brush was dipped in non-alcoholic mouth rinse and,  beginning  with the back molars, the outside upper right quadrant was brushed for 15 seconds. The toothbrush was dipped in the mouth rinse and the outer lower right quadrant was brushed for 15 seconds. This sequence was repeated for the left outer, upper,  and lower quadrant; the sequence was then repeated for the inside upper, lower, right, and left surfaces of the mouth. After the teeth were brushed, the moistened toothbrush was used to brush the anterior two thirds of the resident's tongue. In- terdental plaque was removed using a disposable proximal brush. At the conclusion of mouth care, moistur- izer was applied to the resident's lips and the pulse oximeter was removed.
After mouth care on Day 6, members of the research team col- lected two additional samples, in a manner identical to the process list- ed above, to compare with preinter- vention samples. All oral and fecal samples were processed for DNA using commercially available kits (Kumar et al., 2014). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used with unique barcoded primers to amplify the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene to create an amplicon library from individual samples (Kumar et al., 2014). The multiplexed PCR prod- ucts underwent DNA sequencing using the Illumina(r) MiSeq sequenc- ing platform from a paired-end
250-sequencing run (Kumar et al., 2014).

Data Analysis
Estimates of microbe abundance (as percent of the microbiome in each sample) at each of the time points (pre- and post-protocol) were obtained at up to five differ- ent taxonomic levels, from higher to lower: phylum, class, order, family, and genus. The lower the taxo- nomic level, the smaller the percent abundance per taxon and the more taxa to examine. For the explor-

atory purposes of the current study, microbe abundance was descrip- tively examined at the genus level.
Genera that averaged <0.5% of the microbiome (considering  both
time points) were pooled, labeled as "other taxa," and treated as a single extra taxon. Average abundance by taxon was computed as well as the average change between pre- and post-protocol time points.

RESULTS
Due to the invasive nature of these procedures and potential risk to participants, enrollment was limited to four participants for this proof of concept project. Mean age was 72.5 years (age range = 65 to
82 years). Two individuals were Af- rican American and two were Cau- casian. Three of four participants were men. Mean pre-intervention OHAT was 9.75 (range = 6 to
14) and mean post-intervention OHAT was 3.75 (range = 3 to 5). Mean pulse oximetry before the oral care intervention was 94.54% (range = 86% to 99%) and after the oral care intervention was 94.67% (range = 89% to 99%). Patients' pulse oximetry did not decline dur- ing or after the intervention. No coughing or wet-sounding speech were noted upon conclusion of the mouth care interactions.
Sufficient biological samples were obtained for three individuals for microbiome analyses. Average abun- dance pre- and post-protocol at the genus level is presented in Table A and Table B (available in the on-
line version of this article) for oral and fecal microbiome, respectively. With regard to the oral microbiome, on average the largest decrease in relative abundance was observed in Lactobacillus (-14.4%), whereas the largest increases were observed in Corynebacterium (+5.3%), unspeci- fied genera in the order Clostridiales (+2.5%), unspecified genera in the family Lachnospiraceae (+2.0%), Oscillospira (+1.9%), and Fusobacte- rium (+1.6%). In terms of the fecal

microbiome, the largest average decrease in relative abundance was observed in Prevotella (-8.6%), Veillonella (-6.8%), unspecified genera in the order Clostridiales (-4.7%), Actinomyces (-4.5%), and Leptotrichia (-2.8%), whereas the largest increases were observed in Bacteroides (+7.7%), Blastomonas
(+7.6%), Corynebacterium (+4.3%),
and Fusobacterium (+3.8%).

DISCUSSION
Collecting dental and fecal samples for analyses may support the results from the mouth care intervention. Microbiome analysis allows the evaluation of overall shifts in proportions of microbial species to determine whether the bacteria associated with oral disease, host inflammatory response, and aspiration pneumonia are reduced with this intervention. In the cur- rent study, the genus Lactobacillus was the most responsive to daily mouth care. This genus contains species both beneficial and harmful to the oral cavity; in future studies, changes within individual species will be examined to determine how mouth care altered the oral microbi- ome. The collection of fecal material in future studies will help determine whether positive changes in the oral microbiome affect the  composi- tion of pathogenic microbes in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mouth care protocol for individuals with dysphagia was developed by one of the authors (R.A.J.) while working as a nurse practitioner in a nursing home. She was concerned by the lack of mouth care being provided to individuals with swallowing disorders, espe- cially those with feeding tubes,
and recommended the use of soft toothbrushes dipped in alcohol- free mouthwash. The protocol had never been empirically tested prior to this proof-of-concept study.
Pulse oximetry device was added to monitor potential acute aspiration during the provision of mouth care.

The measurement of oral and fecal samples for microbiome composi- tion analysis reflects the changing understanding of the role of the hu- man microbiome in infectious and inflammatory diseases. Given Medi- care's increased interest in reduc- ing health care-acquired infections and their related costs,  exploring the effects of a dysphagic-specific mouth care protocol on the oral and alimentary canal microbiome may be a wise investment.
The high manpower require- ments and related costs of the in- tervention may present as potential barriers to future and larger research trials. However, the current costs to the health care system of pneumonia and C. difficile infections may out- weigh the costs of the intervention.
Estimated annual acute care costs of pneumonia care and C. difficile infection care are $7 billion and
$4.8 billion, respectively (Dub- berke & Olsen, 2012; Thomas et al., 2012). In addition, C. difficile infections are now categorized as one of the five hospital-acquired condition measures used to reduce Medicare reimbursement (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,
2017). Research into optimal mouth care interventions in this popula- tion should be funded to identify the most efficient and efficacious interventions that could be tested for ultimate application and put- ting evidence-based protocols into policy and practice. These stud-
ies could provide cost-benefit and cost-utility analyses to justify the training and implementation of oral health programs for nursing home patients with dysphagia to improve oral and overall wellness.

LIMITATIONS
As with any pilot project, data presented need to be interpreted  with caution due to the small sample and inability to differentiate be- tween change due to the protocol and change due to expected tech- nical or biological variability. To

avoid these issues, future studies require experimental designs with repeated measurements and sample sizes appropriate to reach conclu- sions with a determined degree of confidence.

CONCLUSION
Individuals with dysphagia who reside in nursing homes are likely to receive inadequate oral hygiene due to the absence of tested and evidence-based mouth care proto- cols. They are at high risk for poor oral health, which is exacerbated by
the lack of dental services and dental insurance from either Medicare or Medicaid. From a policy perspec- tive, the combination of absent evidence-based mouth care proto- cols coupled with insufficient dental coverage create a pool of individuals at great risk for preventable infec- tious illnesses that contribute  to high health care costs. The average daily cost of nursing home care
is $250, compared to the national average cost for one night of in- patient care in a hospital of $2,000 (Rappleye, 2015). In other words, hospital care is approximately 10 times as costly as nursing home care. Evidence-based mouth care pro- tocols need to be tested for quality improvement, efficacy, and cost sav- ings. Such information could lead to changes in policy to cover costs of oral health care and dental care for nursing home residents.
