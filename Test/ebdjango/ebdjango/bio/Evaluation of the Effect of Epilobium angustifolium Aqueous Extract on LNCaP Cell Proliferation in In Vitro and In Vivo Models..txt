Epilobium sp. are commonly used in traditional medicine in the treatment of early stages of benign prostatic hyperplasia and inflammation. It is suggested that a dominating constitu- ent, oenothein B, is responsible for the extracts therapeutic effects. Several bioactivities were established for  extracts and oenothein B in various in vitro models, but due to the questionable bioavailability of this dimeric macrocyclic ellagi- tannin, their significance in the in vivo effects remains un- resolved. We have thus focused our attention on a complex comparative investigation of the in vitro and in vivo activities of phytochemically characterized Epilobium angustifolium aqueous extract and oenothein B on prostate cancer cells pro- liferation.
Incubation of different cell lines with E. angustifolium aqueous extract resulted in a significant reduction of proliferation of PZ-HPV-7 and LNCaP cells, which was partly associated with antiandrogenic activity. These effects were fully congruent with oenothein B, examined in parallel. Oral supplementation of rats implanted with LNCaP cells with E. angustifolium aque- ous extract 50-200 mg/kg b. w. resulted in a reduction of the occurrence of prostatic adenoma up to 13 %. Oenothein B was not detected in the urine and feces of the E. angustifolium aqueous extract-treated group, however, conjugates of nasu- tins gut microbiota metabolites of ellagitannins were de- tected in the urine, while in human volunteers supplemented with Epilobium tea, only urolithin conjugates were present.
Despite observing significant and consistent effects in vitro and in vivo, we were unable to point out unequivocally the fac- tors contributing to the observed E. angustifolium aqueous ex- tract activity, facing the problems of an unknown metabolic fate of oenothein B and interspecies differences in E. angusti- folium aqueous extract gut microbiota metabolism.





Introduction

Infusions of Epilobium sp. (Onagraceae) aerial parts are used in tra- ditional medicine in the early stages of benign prostatic hyperpla- sia (BPH), in urethral and prostatic inflammation, and in micturi-

ported to be efficacious in treating prostate diseases. Different species are collected as plant material sources, including small- flowered species, such as Epilobium parviflorum Schreb., Epilobium montanum L., and Epilobium roseum Schreb., and large-flowered species, such as Epilobium angustifolium L. and, more seldom, Epi-

tion disorders. The use of Epilobium sp. in the treatment of pros-	 	

tatic adenoma has also been reported [1, 2]. In the European mar- ket, many preparations containing Epilobium sp. extracts are pur-

lobium hirsutum L. [1]. However, the most popular due to its accessibility and easy morphological recognition is E. angustifo- lium L. [accepted syn. Chamaenerion angustifolium (L.) Scop. and Chamerion angustifolium (L.) Holub].
The first studies performed almost simultaneously by Lesuisse et al. [3] and Ducrey et al. [4] showed an in vitro effect of Epilobium extracts on 5-a-reductase and aromatase activity, enzymes re- sponsible for the biosynthesis of testosterone and having a poten- tial role in BPH. Oenothein B (OeB), a dimeric macrocyclic ellagi- tannin, which is the dominating constituent of polar extracts pre- pared from Epilobium sp., has been considered to be responsible for these effects. Recent studies on Epilobium sp. herbs have dem- onstrated antiproliferative activity of extracts from different Epi- lobium species on various cell lines, including different types of prostate physiological and tumor cell lines. Maximal inhibitory con- centrations (IC50) varied from 32.2 to 780 ug/mL. These differ- ences in observed activities were probably the consequence of us-
ing extracts with various OeB concentrations (0.03-23.5 %), which
has been consistently indicated as the main active compound [5- 8]. However, only a few in vivo studies have been performed until now. Oral administration of E. angustifolium aqueous extract to un- castrated and testosterone-stimulated castrated rats (40 mg/kg/
b. w. for 14-20 days) resulted in an antiandrogenic effect in  the
first group (significant reduction of the seminal vesicles' weight) and a proandrogenic effect in the latter (induction of prostate and seminal vesicles' weights) [9]. The influence of E. angustifolium dry aqueous extract standardized for total flavonoid (0.44 %), polyphe- nols (9.39 %), and sterols (0.18 %) content on estrogenic receptors a (ERa) and b (ERb) in the animal model was also examined. The extract given (40 mg/kg/b. w.) intragastrically to testosterone- stimulated castrated rats for 21 days slightly increased the level of ERa mRNA and decreased the ERb mRNA in comparison to testos- terone-treated control and similarly, but less pronounced, in com- parison to a positive control receiving finasteride [10]. Other pre- liminary results of the same scientific group showed a slight anti- androgenic effect in rats and swine supplemented with the same extract as above [11, 12]. The pharmacological in vitro and in vivo studies do not resolve the beneficial effect for E. angustifolium preparation in prostate disorders, as they are inconclusive (lack of extracts standardization) or too preliminary (animal studies). The biological effect of Epilobium preparations is considered to be asso- ciated with the presence of OeB, for which several bioactivities were confirmed in in vitro studies [13]. The most significant prob- lem with the transfer of these in vitro data to in vivo observations is the lack of information on the bioavailability of OeB after oral ad- ministration. Since OeB is a dimeric ellagitannin, the recent reports indicating that compounds within this group are metabolized by gut microbiota to urolithins should be considered when peroral in- take of OeB-containing natural products is referred. Our previous study has indeed confirmed that urolithins (low molecular weight dibenzopyran-6-one bioavailable derivatives) are produced from the ellagitannins present in crude Epilobium aqueous extract [7], but recently performed investigations have shown that the pure OeB, in contrary to other tested ellagitannins, is not transformed to urolithins after incubation with human gut microbiota [14].
Taking this point into consideration, we focused our attention on the investigation and comparison of the in vitro and in vivo ef-


fect of phytochemically characterized E. angustifolium aqueous ex- tract on prostate cancer cells proliferation. The aim of the study was also to fill the gap between the OeB in vitro activities and the in vivo effects on prostate cancer cell proliferation of orally admin- istered Epilobium extract.

Results and Discussion

The phytochemical analysis of the extract of E. angustifolium (EA) using the HPLC-DAD-MS/MS method confirmed all previous stud- ies about the presence of hydrolysable tannins (dimeric and tri- meric ellagitannins), flavonol derivatives (quercetin-3-O-glucuro- nide and other glycosides), and phenolic acids (caffeoylquinic ac- ids) and the significant domination of OeB [15-19]. The infusion prepared from commercial tea showed a similar HPLC pattern as the EA extract. This supports the lack of fermentation during the manufacturing that may be observed, especially in Russian prepa- rations, and is characterized by total degradation of oenothein B [20, 21]. The chromatogram and in-depth analysis of a single con- stituent is presented in the Supporting Information (Fig. 1S and Table 1S, Supporting Information).
Proliferation of selected prostate cell lines, human papil- lomavirus 18 (HPV-18) transformed epithelial prostate cells (PZ-HPV-7), prostate epithelial cancer hormone-dependent cells (LNCaP), prostate cancer hormone-independent cells (DU 145), and normal human skin fibroblast cells (NHDFs), was determined by quantitative determination of DNA and expressed as a percent- age of proliferation in comparison with the control cells (100 %). In- cubation of cells with EA extract (20, 50, 70 ug/mL) resulted in a concentration-dependent manner and statistically significant re- duction of proliferation of PZ-HPV-7 and LNCaP cell lines without affecting the viability of normal NHDFs cells (> Fig. 1 A). The prolif- eration of DU 145 cells was slightly affected (69 +- 9 % of control proliferation at a concentration of 50 ug/mL of EA), which confirms our previous results from PC-3 cells (80 +- 6 % of control prolifera- tion at a concentration of 50 ug/mL of EA) [8] that EA is a weak in- hibitor of proliferation of hormone-independent prostate cancer. The inhibition of PZ-HPV-7 cell growth seems to be of importance, as this cell line is considered a model of testing compounds/ex- tracts for BPH treatment [22] and carcinogenesis [23]. The group of Vitalone et al. [5] have demonstrated that an ethanolic extract of E. angustifolium (50 ug/mL) (E. spicatum synonym used in the ar- ticle) decreased PZ-HPV-7 cell viability to 78 +- 2 %, which was con- firmed by our results indicating that EA at the same concentration decreased the viability to 46 +- 5 %. Since OeB is determined as a main constituent of EA extracts, it seems to be responsible for the activity of this medicinal herb [2, 13]. Thus, we also tested the ef- fect of OeB at the concentration corresponding to the content of the compound in the EA extract (70 ug/mL - 7 uM, 50 ug/mL -
uM, 20 ug/mL - 2 uM). We demonstrated that OeB at concentra-
tions of 2, 5, and 10 uM in a concentration-dependent manner sta- tistically and significantly reduced the proliferation of PZ-HPV-7 and LNCaP cell lines without affecting the viability of NHDFs cells (> Fig. 1 B). The proliferation of DU 145 cells was not affected, which is in accordance with the study of Wang et al. establishing the IC50 for the inhibition of DU 145 cell proliferation at the higher


































concentration of 35 uM [24]. The effect of EA and OeB on the pro- liferation of LNCaP cells correlated with the induction of apoptosis. It was observed in a comparable manner to camptothecin and was more significant than for antiandrogens flutamide and bicaluta- mide (> Fig. 1 C), which is in concordance with our previous find- ings [7, 16].
Since EA and OeB were the most selective against hormone- dependent prostate cancer cell lines, we hypothesized that the antiproliferative effects may also depend on antiandrogenic activ- ity. To verify this, we determined the antiproliferative activity of EA and OeB on LNCaP cells cultured in hormone-deprived me- dium supplemented with 20 nM dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT in statistically significant fashion (p < 0.001) stimulated the cell growth by 145 % in comparison to non-treated cells (100 % prolif- eration). EA and OeB were able to inhibit the DHT stimulation and this effect was more significant in comparison with antiandrogens used as a control (> Fig. 2 A).
During DHT stimulation, the androgen receptor (AR) is trans- located from the cytosol to the nucleus where it regulates genes transcription. An applied flow cytometry method allowed us to determine the changes of AR protein in the cytosolic compart- ment. Similar to antiandrogens, oenothein B and EA extract inhib- ited DHT-induced AR translocation to the nucleus (> Fig. 2 C), which correlated with the decrease of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) release (> Fig. 2 D). Such an effect on AR translocation was demonstrated for Scutellaria baicalensis extract (50 ug/mL) and its


main compound baicalin (3 uM) [25] and for resveratrol (10 uM)
[26] as well as for camptothecin (2 uM) [27].
As histone acetylation/deacetylation is an important epigenet- ic event that plays a crucial role in the gene transcription regula- tion by chromatin structure modulation and transcriptional co- regulators such as hormone nuclear receptors accessibility, the ef- fect of EA and OeB on histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity was also determined. EA at concentrations of 10 and 20 ug/mL and OeB at concentrations of 2 and 5 uM inhibited HAT activity in- duced by DHT in LNCaP cells. The effect was weaker in compari- son with a known HAT inhibitor, curcumin (> Fig. 2 B). HAT is also responsible for androgen receptor acetylation, and thus is in- volved in the regulation of prostate cellular growth and apoptosis [28]. Moreover, the non-acetylated AR is preferentially trans- located from the nucleus to the cytoplasm [26]. A limited number of natural HAT inhibitors have been described, such as anacardic acid, garcinol, curcumin, and epigalocathechin-3-gallate [29]. There are also a few studies concerning the effects of plant ex- tracts, which also contain ellagitannins on HAT activity and pros-
tate cancer growth [30-32].
OeB has been isolated from several plants belonging to the families of Onagraceae, Myrtaceae, and Lythraceae as a com- pound with in vitro antiproliferative proprieties against tumor cells [24, 33, 34]. OeB was shown to express the strongest antitumor effect in an in vivo mouse model inoculated with S-180 tumor cells among 45 tested ellagitannins. It should be noted that the com-


















































pounds were administrated intraperitoneally, thus the activity and bioavailability of OeB after oral administration was not taken into consideration in this study [35]. Interestingly, mouse sera col- lected after the oral administration of OeB were shown to inhibit replication of the HIV and herpes viruses, thus indicating that the oral administration of this ellagitannin produced some biological effects in vivo [36]. However, the question of OeB absorption from the digestive tract still remains unresolved.
In order to determine the in vivo effect of EA extract containing 15 % of OeB on prostate epithelial cancer cell proliferation, we used a rat model implanted with LNCaP cells. The scheme of the

experiment is presented in > Fig. 3. As a result of the performed study, the effect of oral administration of the EA extract in doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg b. w./day on the occurrence of tumor hyperplasia in rats with implanted intraperitoneally LNCaP cells was examined. In the case of the rats that obtained a standard di- et, intraperitoneal implantation of prostate cancer cells (group II) resulted in the occurrence of prostatic adenoma in 71 % of the ex- amined rats (> Table 1). In the implanted control group (II), tu- mors were located subcutaneously, mainly in the lymph nodes (Fig. 2S, Supporting Information). The histopathological studies showed that the cells in the epithelium displayed prostate gland




cell characteristics, with the possibility of tumor growth, but with no signs of inflammation. The cells were characterized by a benign phenotype with no features of prostate cancer (> Fig. 4). Also, no deferent ducts were found. Supplementation of animals with EA resulted in a significant reduction of prostatic adenoma occur- rence as follows: the dose of 50 mg/kg b. w. - 13 % (1 out of 8);
100 mg/kg b. w. - 25 % (2 out of 8); 200 mg/kg b. w. - 25 % (2 out
of 8) (> Table 1). In the histopathological picture, it was found that the cell structure in the examined rats (groups III-V) showed the features of necrosis and degeneration with only a small num- ber of cells exhibiting the glandular epithelial cell shape (> Fig. 4). In the non-implanted group (I), spontaneous cancers were not ob- served. The implantation of prostate cancer cells did not cause
any body weight reduction of the examined animals. No statisti- cally significant differences were found in the body mass gain (week 10-21) and neither in the body weight (week 10-21) of the rats that were implanted with cancer cells when compared with those that were not exposed to cancer cells (> Table 1).
In order to point out the potential factors responsible for the observed in vivo effects, the feces and urine of the tested animals were examined using a UHPLC-DAD-MS/MS method. Neither OeB nor characteristic ellagitannins microbiota metabolites, urolithins, were detected in the EA-treated group. However, when comparing the chemical profile of the urine of the treated and non-treated animals, occurrence of the following metabolites was detected as a result of EA administration: A with m/z 429 [M - H]-, B with
m/z 459 [M - H]-, C with m/z 445 [M - H]-, and D with m/z 269
[M - H]-. Fragmentation of these molecular ions (excluding com- pound D) resulted in a neutral loss of 176 (characteristic for glucu- ronides-II phase conjugates), giving MS2 fragment ions of 253, 283, and 269 [M - 176-H]-, respectively (> Fig. 5). Based on UV and MS/MS data, we identified metabolite D as 4,9-dehydroxy-ella- gic acid-nasutin A (NAS) [37, 38]. Consequently, metabolite A was identified as dehydroxy nasutin A glucuronide, metabolite B as methyl-nasutin A glucuronide, and metabolite C as nasutin A glu- curonide. Previously, nasutin A and its metabolites were identified in beavers, pigs, and rats fed with ellagitannin-rich food, but they have so far not been detected in humans [38, 39]. For this reason, we decided to check which metabolites are present in human urine

after ingestion of E. angustifolium herb. The supplementation of a daily diet with E. angustifolium infusion resulted in the appearance of urolithin phase II conjugates in the volunteers' urine (> Fig. 6). In volunteer V1's urine, the dominating compounds were urolithin A glucuronide (GUA) and urolithin B glucuronide (GUB), while in vol- unteer V2's urine, isourolithin A glucuronide (GiUA), GUA, and GUB were found. Neither NAS nor nasutin II phase conjugates, which were found in tested animals, were detected in the volunteers' urine. Similar to the animal study, OeB was not found in any of the samples. Ex vivo incubation with human gut microbiota of V2 with the extract from E. angustifolium resulted in the production of re-
spective urolithin aglycones iUA, UA, and UB (Fig. 3S, Supporting Information). When EA was fractionated with EtOAc extraction, el- lagic acid and digalloyl-HHDP glucoses present in the EtOAc frac- tion (Table 1S and Fig. 1S, Supporting Information) were metabo- lized to urolithins, while only traces of urolithins were formed from aqueous residue being enriched in OeB (Table 1S and Fig. 1S, Sup- porting Information). Incubation of isolated OeB did not result in urolithin formation, which is in contrast to pure vescalagin used as a positive control (Fig. 3S, Supporting Information) and other ella- gitannins tested by Piwowarski et al. [14]. Antiproliferative activity of urolithin A and B in relation to prostate cancer cell lines has been previously demonstrated [7, 40, 41], together with urolithins abil- ity to accumulate in mice prostate glands [40]. In our study, the in vitro comparison of the antiproliferative activity of UA and UB with NAS showed very similar activity (> Fig. 1 D). However, those me- tabolites seem to be only partly responsible for the in vivo extract effects, as the macrocyclic OeB dominating in EA is not prone to degradation by microbiota organisms responsible for urolithins and nasutins production. Further studies are needed to evaluate if the in vitro active OeB is absorbed or transformed to other un- known metabolites not detected in the present study. The influ- ence on the immune system by modulation of the gut microbiome composition and its crosstalk with a host organism could also be taken into consideration as a possible mode of action. In particular, oenothein B was reported to be an immune cell agonist and can enhance the activity of various types of immune cells [13].
In summary, EA demonstrated selective antiproliferative activ- ity towards epithelial cancer cells in in vitro as well as in the in vivo model. Our study supports previous findings that these effects may be partly associated with the antiandrogenenic activity of EA and OeB. However, we were unable to fully resolve the role of OeB in the in vivo activity of the Epilobium extract, as well as to un- equivocally point out the other factors, which could contribute to the observed inhibition of prostate cancer cell growth. Interspe- cies differences in the gut microbiota metabolism of ellagitannins present in the Epilobium extract recognized as the appearance of different types of metabolites in urine nasutins in animal and uro- lithins in human models indicate that the translation of the results from animal to human studies should be performed with care.

The purity of compounds base on HPLC and NMR analysis was 95 %.
Plant material, extract preparation, and characterization
Aerial parts of E. angustifolium L. were collected in a natural state in northeast Poland (near Gietrzwald) in the period of blooming. Botanical   and  anatomical  identification  were   performed   by
A. Kiss, PhD, according to the quoted work [1]. Voucher speci-


mens of the plant material (No. 02031) are deposited in the col- lection of the Department of Pharmacognosy and Molecular Basis of Phytotherapy, Medical University of Warsaw, Poland. Lyophi- lized aqueous extract (EA) containing 15 % of OeB, ethyl acetate fraction (EtOAc), and the aqueous residue were prepared as de- scribed in the Supporting Information. E. angustifolium herb tea, sold as a food product, was purchased from Herbapol Krakow SA and was standardized for 4 % of OeB. For all in vitro and in vivo ani- mal studies, the EA extract was used. For the ex vivo study, EA ex- tract, ethyl acetate fraction, and the aqueous residue were used. For the in vivo study, healthy volunteers received, according to the leaflet, an infusion of E. angustifolium herb.
The extract, fraction, and infusion phytochemical characteriza- tion was performed using an HPLC-DAD-MS/MS method de- scribed in detail in the Supporting Information. The presence of substances, in particular extracts, was confirmed by comparison of the retention times and spectra (UV, MS, MS/MS) with stan- dards or/and literature data.
Cell culture
LNCaP and DU 145 human prostate carcinoma cells and PZ-HPV-7 HPV-18 transformed epithelial prostate cells were obtained from ATCC, and NHDFs were purchased from Lonza. Cells were culti- vated at 37 degC and 5 % CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. LNCaP cells were cultivated in standard phenol-red DMEM medium sup- plemented with 10 % FBS, 1 % sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicil-






















































lin, and 100 ug/mL streptomycin or charcoal stripped DMEM me- dium supplemented with 10 % CS-FBS, 1 % sodium pyruvate, 4 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 ug/mL streptomycin. PZ-HPV-7 cells were cultivated in K-SFM medium with 5 % BPE and EGF (5 ng/mL), DU 145 cells were cultured in phenol-red EMEM medium supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin,

and 100 ug/mL streptomycin, and NHDFs in phenol-red DMEM medium supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 ug/mL streptomycin. For assays, cells were seeded (2-4x 104/well) in 24-well plates in culture medium and allowed to at- tach for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were incubated with the tested compounds for 72 h. The EA extract and OeB were dissolved in


PBS, while other compounds were dissolved in DMSO. The final concentration of DMSO was less than 0.5 %.
Cell proliferation assay
Cell proliferation was measured as described by Kiss et al. [8]. Cul- ture medium was removed from the plate wells and the attached cells were gently washed with 0.9 % saline. The cells were then lysed by freezing in 400 uL of deionized water. Hoechst 33258 so- lution (2.5 ug/mL) in phosphate buffer (pH = 8.3) was added to the cell lysates, and fluorescence of DNA-Hoechst 33258 dye complexes was measured on a BioTek Synergy 4 microplate reader with Gen5 software (BioTek Instruments) (ex.  356 nm,  em.  440 nm). A calibration curve with Herring Testes DNA was used to calculate the DNA amount per well.
Detection of apoptosis by flow cytometry
Cells were harvested (0.0125 % trypsin-EDTA, 2-3 min), washed with DPBS, and stained with FITC-Annexin V/PI according to the manufacturer's instructions (FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I). Stained cells were analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytom- eter with CellQuest Pro Software (BD Biosciences). Data from 10 000 events were recorded. Before each experiment, compen- sation (using untreated cells, cells with Annexin, and cells with propidium iodide) was performed and quadrants were set.
Prostate-specific antigen secretion
LNCaP cells were seeded in 24-well plates (4 x 104 cells per well) in charcoal stripped DMEM medium supplemented with 10 % CS-FBS and treated with DHT (20 nM) and the indicated extract/com- pounds. Culture media from the wells were collected and centri- fuged. PSA secretion was measured in the supernatants using a PSA total ELISA kit (Demeditec) according to manufacturer's in- structions.
Androgen receptor presence in the cytosol
For AR presence in the cytosol, LNCaP cells were stained with anti- AR antibody, following the work of Grupillo et al. [44] and the method of Perez et al. [45], and analyzed with a flow cytometer. LNCaP cells were seeded in T-25 bottles (0.5-1x 106cells per bottle) in CS medium, then treated with DHT and extract or compounds. The cells were harvested (0.125 % trypsin-EDTA, 2- 3 min), washed with cold PBS, and fixed for 10 min with cold 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS. Next, the cells were washed and per- meabilized with ice-cold methanol for 15 min. After washing, cells were stained with antiandrogen receptor antibody (5 uL, 30 min). Stained cells were analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer with CellQuest Pro Software.
Nuclear histone acetyltransferase activity
LNCaP cells were seeded in 6-well plates (1.5 x 105cells per well) in charcoal stripped DMEM medium supplemented with 10 % CS-FBS and treated with DHT (20 nM) and the indicated extract/com- pounds. After cell treatment, the medium was aspirated and the nuclear lysates were prepared using a nuclear extract kit (Actif Motif). The protein content in the lysates was measured by a BCA protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manu- facturer's protocol. HAT activity was determined according to


the manufacturer's protocols (Actif Motif) using 20 ug of nuclear lysates, respectively. Fluorescence was measured on a BioTek Syn- ergy 4 microplate reader with Gen5 software (ex. 360 nm, em. 465 nm).
Animals
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 37) were obtained from the Animal Laboratory, Department of General and Experimental Pathology, Medical University of Warsaw. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee, Medical University of Warsaw (permission number 46/2014; April 15, 2014). The animals were kept under the standard conditions of the animal house with a 12-h light-dark cycle at a temperature 22 degC. They had free access to food (stan- dard diet: Labofeed H) and water.
In vivo animal studies
The experiment was conducted for 90 days. After the adaptation period (10 days, from 60 to 70 days of rats age), the animals were randomly divided into five experimental groups. The first (n = 6) and second (n = 7) groups were not supplemented and served as a control (I and II). The three other groups were supplemented once a day with Epilobium extract (EA) as follows: 50 mg/kg b. w. (n = 8, III); 100 mg/kg b. w. (n = 8, IV); 200 mg/kg b.w (n = 8, V). The rats were supplemented with the extract suspended in water,
mL daily via gavage, from 70 days until 150 days of age (sacri- fice time by decapitation). Animals that were fed only with the standard diet (without supplementation) received 0.4 mL of water. The rats from all groups were implanted with prostate can- cer cells. The cancer cells (LNCaP) were implanted intraperito- neally in the rats in the amount of 1 x 106 (in PBS 0.4 mL) on day 90 of their lifetime (Fig > 3). The rats were sacrificed by decapita- tion at 150 days of age, and tumors were evaluated histopatho- logically. In order to obtain rat urine samples, the animals were placed in individual metabolic cages for 24 h. Urine and feces were collected once a week.
The tissues were recorded in a buffered formalin solution, then they were dehydrated, sealed in paraffin, and cut into 4 um thick slices. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of tissue and cell sections was applied and the sections were evaluated using a BX43 Olym- pus research microscope.
Subject and dosing procedure
Two healthy volunteers (male aged 30; male aged 40) were asked to drink an infusion of E. angustifolium herb (2.0 g herb tea
+ 200 mL of boiling water, 10 min) twice a day, according to the leaflet, for the following 4 days. One week before and during the study, intake of ellagitannin-containing food products was forbid- den and intake of polyphenol-rich products was reduced to a minimum. Urine was collected from day 0 to day 4 and stored at
- 20 degC. The study respected the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki for the ethical treatment of human subjects for biomedical research. Volunteers provided written informed consent and a votum of an ethics committee was not necessary due to the country's law. The volunteers' urine samples were purified using a solid-phase ex- traction (SPE) method and analyzed with a UHPLC-DAD-MS/MS method.

Gut microbiota ex vivo metabolism
The evaluation of microbiota ex vivo metabolism of ellagitannins was performed as described previously [46]. To acquire anaerobic conditions, brain heart infusion (BHI), DIFCO was boiled and im- mediately cooled down before the experiment. Ten mg of OeB, 10 mg of vescalagin, 40 mg of Epilobium extract (EA), the EtOAc fraction, and aqueous residue were dissolved in 1 mL of distilled water and sterilized by filtration through Ophtalsart hydrophilic syringe filters (0.2 mm; Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH). One mL of 10 % fecal slurry in BHI and 0.5 mL of extract/compound solu- tion were added to 8.5 mL of BHI. The batch cultures were incu- bated in a sealed container under anaerobic conditions using GENbox anaer sachets (bioMerieux) at 37 degC. After 24 h, the batch
culture was centrifuged at 12 000 g, filtered, and directly sub- jected to UHPLC-DAD-MS/MS. Three mL of supernatant were also purified using the SPE method.
Solid-phase extraction purification and UHPLC-DAD-MS/MS analysis of urine and feces
Collected urine samples were purified and concentrated using the SPE method. An SPE Chromabond C18 Hydra column (Macherey- Nagel) was preconditioned with 10 mL of MeOH and 10 mL of H2O. Four mL of urine acidified with 0.1 % HCOOH were applied to the column, which was then washed with 10 mL of H2O before elution with 5 mL of MeOH. The eluate was evaporated to dryness at 40 degC, redissolved in 0.5 mL MeOH, and subjected to UHPLC-DAD-MS/MS analysis.
For analysis of  the metabolites present in the rat  feces, two
sample preparation methods were applied. One gram of feces were extracted 2 times with 8 mL of 70 % MeOH acidified with
0.1 % HCOOH for 15 min using an ultrasonic bath. The extract was centrifuged at 12 000 g. Pooled 70 % MeOH extracts were evaporated to dryness at 40 degC, redissolved in 1 mL of acidified 70 % MeOH. Next, 0.5 mL of the extract was filtered through an Ophtalsart hydrophilic syringe filter (0.2 mm) and subjected to UHPLC-DAD-MS/MS analysis. The remaining 0.5 mL of the extract was evaporated to dryness, redissolved in 10 mL of water, and pu- rified using the SPE method as described above.
Two grams of feces were extracted with 15 mL of water for 30 min using an ultrasonic bath. The extract was centrifuged in 12 000 g and purified using the SPE method as described above and analyzed using the UHPLC-DAD-MS/MS method (described in detail in Supporting Information). The presence of urolithin A, iso-urolithin A, urolithin B, and urolithin C was confirmed by com- paring the retention times and UV and m/z spectra with authentic samples. Other compounds were tentatively assigned based on their chromatographic properties and UV and MS spectra.
Data analysis
The results are expressed as the mean +- SD of three independent experiments performed at least in duplicate. All analyses were performed using Statistica 12 software. Statistical significance of differences between means was established by ANOVA with Dunnett's post hoc test. P values below 0.05 were considered sta- tistically significant.

Supporting information
Extract and fractions preparation, phytochemical characterization by HPLC-DAD-MS/MS, and chromatograms representing uroli- thins formed during incubation of the extract, fractions, and OeB by a human gut microbiota ex vitro culture as well as photos of tu- mor hyperplasia in rats with implanted prostate cancer cells are available as Supporting Information.
