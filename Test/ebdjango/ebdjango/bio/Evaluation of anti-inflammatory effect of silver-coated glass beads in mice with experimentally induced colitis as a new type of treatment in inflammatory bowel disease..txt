Background: Recent studies point at the anti-inflammatory action of silver through induction of apoptosis of inflammatory cells via oxidative stress, promotion of wound healing as well as antimicrobial effect. Our aim was to design a new formulation based on silver and validate its anti-inflammatory activity in the mouse models of colitis.
Methods: Silver-coated glass beads were prepared using a magnetron sputtering method and a standard magnetron sputtering gun equipped with pure silver target. Colitis was induced by the ic administration of TNBS into colon (to mimic Crohn's disease) and addition of DSS to drinking water (to imitate ulcerative colitis). Evaluation of inflammation was performed based on macroscopic and microscopic scoring, quantification of the myeloperoxidase activity and colonic microflora analysis.
Results: Silver-coated glass beads administered ic alleviated intestinal inflammation in mouse models of colitis, induced by TNBS and DSS. This alleviation of colitis resulted principally from changes in the gut microflora. The anti-inflammatory action of the new formulation was associated predominantly with the presence of the silver nanolayer on the beads, and to a lesser extent the size of glass polymer units. Conclusions: The application of the newly developed formulation employing silver-coated glass beads has the potential to be translated to clinical conditions for the efficient treatment of IBD.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic, recurring inflammatory conditions, represented by Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The former develops at 20-35 years of age and may concern any segment of the GI tract; however, the distal ileum and further parts are mostly affected. UC, which occurs predominantly at ages 15-30 and 60-80 is limited to the colon . There are also differences in their microscopic image: CD develops within the entire bowel wall and UC affects the gut mucosa (for review see: ). Common for both diseases is that

the alleviation of symptoms and maintenance of remission require a long-term treatment which in most cases is associated with the development of adverse side effects; with the current state of knowledge, there is no efficient cure available to the IBD patients. Moreover for some, like biologic drugs (e.g. infliximab), there is an unsatisfactory number of responders.
The main limitation in IBD treatment is our understanding - or rather the lack of thereof - of factors triggering the disease. Environmental, nutritional, and genetic background is often taken into consideration when studying the distorted response of the immune system leading to IBD (for review see: ). Since relatively recently, there is a major focus on the microbial content of the gut and its influence on the development of the inflammation and the course of the disease. For example, abnormal colonization of the ileal mucosa by adherent/invasive E. coli has been shown in IBD patients . Importantly, both quantitative and qualitative

changes in microbiota composition are regarded as a possible trigger of the inflammatory process in the gut .
Silver and its preparations have a long history of application for wound healing and anti-microbial agents (for review see: ). Importantly, the external use of silver is generally regarded as safe and without long-term adverse side effects; even when hepato- toxicity or bluish-gray discoloration of the skin (argyria - like symptoms) develop, they are reversible upon discontinuation of the treatment . Recent studies point at anti-inflammatory action of silver through induction of apoptosis of inflammatory cells via oxidative stress and the above-mentioned promotion of wound healing ( and references therein). Noteworthy, the size of the silver particles used for the treatment of inflammation, as well as the ionization state (metallic silver vs. silver ions) may affect their interaction with biological membranes and passage to inflamed sites, resulting in differences in anti-inflammatory efficacy .
Several novel formulations based on silver have recently been reported and their anti-inflammatory activity validated in animal models. For example, nanocrystalline silver (NPI 32101) adminis- tered intracolonically (ic) or orally alleviated colitis in a rat model mimicking UC and was as effective as sulfasalazine . Others include carbon nanoscrolls (CNSs) build of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), graphene oxide (GO)-based nanocomposites, nanosized silica hybrid silver complex (NSS) and silver nanoparticles complexed with a potent antioxidant, alpha-lipoic acid .
Our aim was to design a new formulation based on silver and validate its anti-inflammatory activity in the mouse model of colitis. In the course of the study, we developed silver-coated glass beads, which attenuated colonic inflammation in TNBS- and DSS- treated mice principally, but not exclusively through antimicrobial action. The application of this newly developed formulation has the potential to be translated to clinical conditions for the efficient treatment of IBD.

Materials and methods

Drugs and reagents

Borosilicate glass beads were purchased from Merck (Warsaw, Poland). All drugs and reagents, unless otherwise stated, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Poznan,, Poland).

Preparation of silver-coated glass beads

Silver-coated glass beads (850-1400 mm and 5 mm) were prepared as described previously , using a magnetron sputtering method and a standard 2" magnetron sputtering gun equipped with pure silver (4N) target. Deposition of silver layer lasted 360 s with the sputtering power of 270 W. To confirm the correctness of the method, scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations of the microstructure of the coatings as well as energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of chemical composition were performed (data not shown).

Animals

Male BALB/c mice (22-28 g) were obtained from the Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine (Lodz, Poland). Animals were housed at a constant temperature (22 2 oC), on a 12 h light/dark cycle in sawdust-lined plastic cages with free access to chow and tap water. Animal protocols were approved by the Medical University of Lodz Animal Care Committee (Protocol #9/LB16/ 2016). All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals used. Groups of 8-10 animals were used in all experiments.

Induction of colitis TNBS model
Colitis was induced by the ic administration of TNBS, as
described previously . Briefly, mice were lightly anesthetized with 1% isoflurane (Baxter Healthcare Corp, IL, USA) and TNBS (4 mg in 0.1 mL of 30% ethanol in saline) was administered into colon through a catheter inserted 3 cm proximally to the anus. Previous experiments showed that the dose of TNBS used in the study induced reproducible colitis.

DSS model
Colitis was induced by addition of DSS to drinking water starting from day 0 to day 5 (4% wt/vol; molecular weight 40,000; MP Biomedicals, Aurora, OH, Lot No. 5237K), as previously described . On days 6 and 7 the animals received  water without DSS. Control animals received tap water only. Animal body weight was monitored daily and mean water and food consump- tion was recorded.

Pharmacological treatments

Non-coated glass beads and silver-coated glass beads (5 beads/ animal, ic) were administered once daily on days 3-6 from induction of colitis. The number of beads per animal was selected
based on Siczek et al. . Control animals received saline as vehicle (100 mL, ic). Vehicle had no effect on the observed parameters.
Evaluation of inflammation TNBS model
Animals were killed by cervical dislocation 7 days after TNBS
application. The colons were instantly removed, opened longitu- dinally, washed with saline, and immediately examined. Macro- scopic colonic damage was assessed using an established semi- quantitative scoring system by adding individual scores for ulcers, colonic shortening, and wall thickness, presence of hemorrhage, fecal blood and diarrhea. For ulcer score and colonic shortening, the following scale was used: 0.5 points for each 0.5 cm of ulcerated tissue; shortening of the colon, 1 point for >15% and 2 points for >25% (based on the mean length of the colon in untreated mice of 8.38 0.11, n = 8). The wall thickness was measured in mm. The presence of hemorrhage, fecal blood, or diarrhea increased the score by 1 point for each additional feature. The macroscopic scoring was performed in a blind manner.
After macroscopic scoring, segments of the distal colon were stapled flat, mucosal side up, onto cardboard and fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 24 h at 4 oC. Samples were then dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 mm on a microtome, and mounted onto slides. Subsequently, sections were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined using a Motic AE31 microscope (Ted Pella, Redding, CA, USA). Photographs were taken using a digital imaging system consisting of a digital camera (Moticam 2300, Ted Pella, Redding, CA, USA) and image analysis software (MoticImages Plus 2.0, Motic Deutschland GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). Microscopic total damage score was deter- mined in a blind manner based on the presence (score = 1) or absence (score = 0) of goblet cell depletion, the presence (score = 1) or absence (score = 0) of crypt abscesses, the destruction of mucosal architecture (normal = 1,  moderate = 2, extensive = 3), the extent of muscle thickening (normal = 1, moderate = 2, exten- sive = 3), and the presence and degree of cellular infiltration (normal = 1, moderate = 2, transmural = 3).
To assess granulocyte infiltration and to quantify the myelo- peroxidase activity (MPO), the method adapted by Fichna et al. was

used . Briefly, 1-cm segments of colon were weighed and homogenized in hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HTAB) buffer (0.5% HTAB in 50 nM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0;
50 mg tissue/mL) immediately after isolation. Homogenate was centrifuged (15 min, 13,200 rpm, 4 oC) and 7 mL of supernatant was added to each well on a 96-well plate, containing 200 mL  of 500 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), supplemented with
0.167 mg/mL of O-dianisidine hydrochloride and 0.05 mL of 1% H2O2. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm (iMark Microplate Reader, Biorad, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, UK). All meas- urements were performed in triplicate. MPO was expressed in
milliunits per gram of wet tissue, 1 unit being the quantity of enzyme able to convert 1 mmol of H2O2 to water in 1 min at room temperature. Units of MPO activity per 1 min were calculated from a standard curve using purified peroxidase enzyme.

DSS model
Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation on day 7 following addition of DSS in the drinking water. The entire colon was

immediately isolated and weighed with fecal content. Colon was then opened along mesenteric border and fecal material was removed. Total macroscopic damage score was calculated for each animal and included: stool consistence (0-3), colon epithelial damage considered as number of ulcers (0-3), and colon length and weight scores (0-4), where score = 0 means no inflammation. The presence (score = 1) or absence (score = 0) of fecal blood was also recorded. The macroscopic scoring was performed in a blind manner.

Colonic microflora analysis

The collected material (mouse intestinal contents) was placed into sterile flasks where 5 mL of Ringer's solution was added to be afterwards vortexed for 5 min and left aside for 15 min to deposit as sediment. Several 20-fold serial dilutions were prepared in physiological salt solution. Then, in two replications, 0.1 mL of each dilution was inoculated onto the surface of the following agar media: enriched nutrient agar medium (BTL, Poland) to determine

total bacteria load, Endo LES agar medium (BTL, Poland) to establish total coliform bacteria count, mFC medium (BTL, Poland) for total fecal E. coli number, Iron sulfide agar (Biomerieux, Poland) for total count of Clostridium bacteria, MRS agar (BTL Poland) for enumeration of mesophilic lactic acid bacteria of the Lactobacillus genus. The settled cultures were incubated under appropriate conditions. To determine total count of aerobic bacteria, coliforms and bacteria from the Clostridium genus, the incubation was conducted at 37 oC temperature for 24-48 h, while to  establish total fecal Escherichia load - at 44 oC temperature for 18-24 h. As for quantification of mesophilic lactic acid bacteria of the Lactobacillus genus, the incubation was performed at 30 oC for  3-5 days. The Clostridium and Lactobacillus bacteria cultures were incubated under controlled atmospheric conditions, with using the paper sachet anaerobic gas generator - GENbag anaer (Biomerieux, Poland). After the standard incubation time, the growing colonies were counted automatically and converted according to the PN- ISO4832 norms. The number of types of colony morphologies was established and expressed as colony-forming units in 1 g of mouse intestinal contents under study [cfu/g].

Statistics

Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). The data are expressed as means SEM, except for colonic microflora analysis, where expressed in logharithmic scale as means SEM. One-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc test was used in macroscopic and microscopic scoring, as well as MPO analysis. One-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc test were used for microbial analyses, p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

TNBS model

The ic administration of TNBS (5 mg in 0.1 mL of 30% ethanol in saline) produced robust inflammation in the mouse colon, as shown by a significant increase in macroscopic score (4.31 0.50 vs. 0.70 0.06  for  TNBS-treated mice  vs. control, respectively; p < 0.001;  A)  and ulcer  score (1.22  0.10  vs.  0.01 0.01; p < 0.001; B), and a non-significant decrease in colon length and increase in bowel thickness (C and D, respectively). Moreover, administration of TNBS in mice resulted in significant infiltration of the colon wall with neutrophils, as evidenced by increased MPO activity (12.30 1.44 vs. 6.10 0.66 units for TNBS- treated mice vs. control, respectively; p < 0.001; E). Finally, the architecture of the colonic wall was compromised, as shown by a significant increase in the microscopic damage score (9.12 +- 1.31


vs. 3.30 0.20 for TNBS-treated mice vs. control, respectively;
p < 0.001; F).
Treatment with silver-coated glass beads (5 beads/animal, ic, OD) attenuated TNBS-induced colitis in mice, as shown by a significant decrease in the macroscopic score (p < 0.001), ulcer score (p < 0.001) and MPO activity (p < 0.001; A, B and E, respectively), and a non-significant increase in the colon length (C) and reduction in bowel thickness and microscopic score (D and F, respectively).
To examine whether the anti-inflammatory effect of silver- coated glass beads can be attributed to the silver nanolayer, the experiments were also performed  for  non-coated glass  beads.  A significant attenuation of inflammation was observed only for ulcer score (p < 0.05; B) and MPO activity (p < 0.001; E). Importantly, the anti-inflammatory action of silver-coated glass beads was significantly stronger than that of non-coated glass beads for macroscopic score (p < 0.05; A) and ulcer score (p < 0.05; B).
Colonic microflora analysis showed that the ic administration of TNBS significantly increased total bacteria count (9.33 0.33 vs.
6.99 0.28 cfu/g of stool content for TNBS-treated mice vs. control; p < 0.001; ) and non-significantly increased the count for Clostridium perfringens, E. coli and coli form bacteria (). Characterization of the anti-microbial activity of the silver-coated glass beads revealed that they significantly decreased the E. coli count (p < 0.05; ) and non-significantly lowered the total bacteria, Clostridium perfringens and coli form bacteria (). Non-coated glass beads were equally efficient against Clostridium perfringens and coli form bacteria, and less efficient against total bacteria and E. coli (). Unexpectedly, the Lactobacillus sp. count was increased after TNBS administration; moreover, treatment with silver-coated glass beads and non-coated glass beads did not affect the presence of Lactobacillus sp. in the inflamed mouse gut.
To further verify whether the size of glass beads and/or the dose of silver introduced to the inflamed mouse colon affect their anti-
inflammatory activity, silver-coated glass beads and non-coated glass beads with a diameter of 5 mm were used. To facilitate their administration, the glass beads were suspended in saline. Interestingly, smaller silver-coated glass beads and non-coated
glass beads had no effect on TNBS-induced inflammation in the mouse colon (data not shown).

DSS model

The 4% DSS in drinking water, given to mice from day 0 to day 5, induced inflammation in the mouse colon, as evidenced by macroscopic score (14.33 0.24 vs. 0.33 0.33 for DSS-treated mice vs. control, respectively; p < 0.001; A), colon damage

As shown in , DSS significantly increased total bacteria count (10.80 0.19 vs. 8.94 0.41 cfu/g of stool content for DSS- treated mice vs. control, respectively; p < 0.05) and coli form bacteria count (10.23 +- 0.22 vs. 7.62 +- 0.0.45 cfu/g of stool content

Silver-coated glass beads (5 beads/animal, ic, OD) significantly decreased total bacteria count (p < 0.05, ) and non-significantly lowered coli form bacteria count, and increased Lactobacillus sp. count. Non-coated glass beads had a weaker antimicrobial effect as regards total bacteria (); noteworthy, they had a stronger inhibitory effect on Clostridium perfringens and E. coli count; however, they further decreased the Lactobacillus sp. count as compared to DSS-treated mice ().

In this study we showed that silver-coated glass beads administered intracolonically alleviate intestinal inflammation in

mouse models of colitis, induced by TNBS (to mimic Crohn's disease) and DSS (to imitate ulcerative colitis). Importantly, the anti-inflammatory action of this new formulation is associated predominantly with the presence of the silver nanolayer on the beads, and to a lesser extent the size of glass polymer units. Alleviation of colitis induced by silver-coated glass beads presumably results from changes in the gut microflora; however, full characterization of their action is still warranted.
Based on our observations and available literature, it can be concluded that inflammation of the colon in animals exposed to TNBS and DSS is often associated with significant changes in intestinal motility. Diarrhea is predominant when colitis develops; however, destruction of gut wall integrity, which is mostly typical for TNBS-induced inflammation causes fecal matter deposition in ulcers and protruding to the lumen of the intestine, which - paradoxically - hampers elimination of the feces and promotes further damage to the colon. The idea behind the new formulation validated in this study was thus to introduce polymer particles into the inflamed colon, which would help release the deposited fecal matter. The strategy proved to be successful, as both silver-coated and non-coated glass beads attenuated colon damage parameters; moreover, the anti-inflammatory potency of both formulations was similar in case of several parameters of the inflammation in the TNBS model, in which - as mentioned above - the mouse colon is more prone to be blocked by the debris.
However, the silver coating is still crucial for the anti-
inflammatory activity of the new formulation. Our results clearly show that the beneficial effect of silver-coated glass beads is significantly (in case of macroscopic score and ulcer score in the TNBS model) or non-significantly, but with a visible trend (in case of macroscopic score and colon damage score in the DSS model) more pronounced than that of the non-coated beads. Our formulation elegantly adds to a number of attempts that have been made to use preparations containing silver as therapeutics that cure or protect from microbial invasion, inflammation and cancer. For example, silver sulphadiazine is a topical anti-infective, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and used worldwide for dermal injuries, with a broad antibacterial spectrum . Recently, Kyros et al. reported the synthesis of the new mixed ligand silver(I) chloride complex and Iqbal et al.  developed a binuclear silver(I) N-heterocyclic carbene complex with anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic effect. Other silver- based preparations, in which silver nanoparticles play the crucial role, have recently been reviewed in one of our papers .
In line with earlier reports, we showed that silver-coated glass beads act in the inflamed gut primarily by reducing the number of pathogenic bacteria, Clostridium perfringens and E. coli  and increasing beneficial strains, like Lactobacillus sp. The detailed mechanism of anti-bacterial action of the new formulation has not been examined in our study, but could include I. interaction with bases in the DNA strand and decrease of the ability to replicate and/ or II. attachment to the cell membrane surface, resulting in modification of its permeability, inhibition of cell respiration and further DNA damage for review see: ). It needs to be mentioned here that the extent of the antimicrobial action of the new formulations in the TNBS model could have been distorted due to the procedure of TNBS instillation, which is integral for this model. Namely, the solvent for TNBS (30% EtOH in saline), its volume (0.1 mL) and route of administration (ic) used to induce colitis may cause extensive eradication of the gut microflora. However, as evidenced by the number of total bacteria in the TNBS-treated mouse colon vs. control, the influence of the instillation procedure on the general outcome of the assay seems negligible, and still susceptible to anti-inflammatory treatment, as shown by  our results of the colonic microflora analysis.


Mechanisms of action unrelated to microbiome may also be considered when characterizing the anti-inflammatory effect of silver-coated glass beads. Using animal models of inflammatory skin disease and the rat model of UC, Bhol et al. showed that NPI
32101 (nanocrystalline silver) decreases inflammation and down- regulates the production of IL-12, IL-1b, TNF-a, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 ; noteworthy, these proteins
may also be involved in the pathogenesis of CD . In addition, Tomasello et al.  found that silver-containing preparations may affect proliferation of fibroblasts which coun- teract the infectious action of pyogenic bacteria and promote wound closure; however, because of the ambiguity on the role of silver in this process, further research is necessary.
One of the greatest challenges in the design of the study was the selection of an appropriate dose of silver introduced into the inflamed mouse colon. In our earlier report  we have shown that the minimum thickness of silver nanolayer deposited on glass beads used in the animal models of gastrointestinal diseases (when the number of beads administered is five) should be higher than 50 nm to produce an anti-inflammatory effect. Here we confirmed this observation, extending it to the DSS model of colitis in mice. Furthermore, here we showed that not only the thickness of the silver nanolayer, but also the size of the glass polymer particle is crucial for alleviation of colitis. With the administration of a suspension  containing  significantly  smaller  silver-coated glass
beads  (5  vs.  850-1400 mm),  we have  not  achieved  any anti-
inflammatory effect in the TNBS-challenged colon, what will now be taken into consideration in further research on this new formulation. Another important issue that will now need to be addressed is the possible therapeutic window, i.e. the dose of silver effective in inflammation vs. toxic dose. Lee and Moon  reported that topically applied silver sulfadiazine impaired dermal regeneration and decreased mechanical strength of dermal tissue via the cytotoxic effect on human dermal fibroblasts. On the other hand, there are cases of Clostridium difficile colitis after post- operative treatment with silver sulfadiazine that progressed to Toxic Megacolon and perforation . In line, a permanent bluish- gray discoloration of the skin (argyria) or eyes (argyrosis), as well as liver and kidney damage, irritation of the skin, respiratory and intestinal tract dysfunction, and changes in blood morphology may develop after administration of silver, in particular its soluble forms (as reviewed in ). Finally, the antimicrobial activity of the silver-coated venous catheter was accompanied by an acceleration of blood clotting and a higher risk of thrombosis . Despite being generally regarded as safe, yet effective, the newly developed silver-coated glass beads need careful consideration of their potential side effects.
In conclusion, this is the first report showing the potential of
silver-coated glass beads as anti-inflammatory treatment in IBD. We will now continue with the research on the mechanism of action and site-specificity of this new preparation, as well as further development of the drug formulation to be potentially used in clinical conditions. Finally, attempts will be made to coat the glass beads with nanolayers of other transition metals that can be used as safe and efficient alternatives to anti-inflammatory drugs currently available.
