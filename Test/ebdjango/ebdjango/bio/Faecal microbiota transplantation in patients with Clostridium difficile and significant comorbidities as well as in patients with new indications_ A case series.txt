transplant patients, two liver transplant patients and a patient with chronic lymphatic leukaemia. We also reviewed those treated with FMT for indications other than rCDI: Salmonella carriage (two patients), trimethylaminuria (two patients), small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO; one patient), and lymphocytic colitis (one patient), as well as a common variable immunodeficiency patient with chronic norovirus infection and ESBL-producing Escherichia coli (E. coli ) carriage. Of the thirteen rCDI patients treated with FMT, eleven cleared the CDI. The observed adverse events were not directly attributable to FMT. Concerning the special indications, both Salmonellas and ESBL-producing E. coli were eradicated. One trimethylaminuria patient and one SIBO-patient reported a reduction of symptoms. Three patients did not experience a benefit from FMT: chronic norovirus, lymphocytic colitis and the other fish malodour syndrome. There were no reported side effects in this group. FMT appeared to be safe and effective for immunocompromised patients with rCDI. FMT showed promise for the eradication of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, but further research is warranted.

INTRODUCTION
The intestinal microbiota is an area of active research. Knowledge of the human microbiota has been accu mulating rapidly in recent years. The gut bacteria was previously regarded as passive or harmful waste, but the intestinal microbiota is currently respected as a wellorchestrated organism with an active role in the development of immunity and maintenance of health[14].
Microbial imbalance, dysbiosis, is suggested to play a role in many different diseases. The microbiota holds many expectations as a new treatment target. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a straight forward way to change the microbial composition of the intestine[14]. FMT has been shown to induce profound and longlasting changes in the microbiota, offering a means to modify the gut microbiota relatively per manently for the treatment of microbiotaassociated diseases[5].
FMT has become a widely accepted treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI)[69]. We, among others, have shown that FMT through colonoscopy is an effective treatment for rCDI[5]. Experience in many centres has shown that FMT is also safe when performed to a high standard[1013].
The risk of adverse events of FMT is low in well performed studies[6]. Rigorous screening of the donor is mandatory. Without proper screening, there is a

 		possibility of transmitting infectious diseases and

Core tip: Knowledge of faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in immunocompromised patients and patients with conditions other than recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI) is scarce. We reviewed 13 FMT- treated patients with rCDI and major comorbidities as well as 8 patients with new indications. In our cohort, FMT appeared to be safe and effective for immuno- compromised patients: dialysis patients, human immu- nodeficiency virus patients, solid organ transplant patients and a patient with chronic lymphatic leuka- emia. Of the patients treated for indications other than rCDI, the most promising results were successful eradication of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Eradication of chronic Salmonella carriage in two patients with FMT represents the first cases reported to date.

a possibility of transmitting conditions that FMT is suspected to ameliorate, such as obesity[14].
All FMT should be performed at a health care unit by professionals who are familiar with the procedure[15]. FMT is currently indicated only for rCDI[15]. If FMT is used for other indications, then patients should be carefully evaluated, and the results, whether positive or negative, should be reported. Our group has treated a few patients with conditions other than rCDI and outside of ongoing study programmes. Such cases have been evaluated carefully on an individual basis by a gastroenterologist, an infectious disease specialist and a microbiologist.
Although FMT has been effective and generally safe in published studies, data concerning FMT in certain special groups are scarce[16]. More information is needed regarding the safety of FMT in immuno suppressed and other special groups such as patients undergoing haemodialysis[12]. In our FMTtreated patients, we gathered information on patients with significant comorbidities, such as immunedeficient patients, patients with an organ transplant and hae

in our practice is colonoscopy. The suspension is administered into the cecum and ascending colon. Preceding the colonoscopy, the patients undergo bowel

 		lavage by polyethylene glycol solution (between 35 L).

Study design
Of the patients treated with FMT in Helsinki University Hospital, we searched for those treated for rCDI and having major comorbidities and those treated for indications other than rCDI. We included dialysis patients and patients with known immune deficiencies in the rCDI group; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), organ transplant or hematologic disease. We found 13 patients with rCDI and major comorbidities and 8 patients with conditions other than rCDI. We review the patient histories, the outcomes and adverse events of each patient.

Ethical aspects
Since FMT policy and legislation differ from country to country[17,18], we consulted the Finnish Medicines Agency (Fimea), which is the national competent authority for regulating pharmaceuticals and blood and tissue products. Fimea noted that stool does not fall under the category of pharmaceuticals and did not consider it relevant to the establishment of new regulations specifically for FMT. In Finland, FMT studies do not require approval of the drug authority Fimea.
In Finland, FMT may be used by doctors based on their own judgement. We recommend that clinicians using FMT follow international guidelines[15,19]. FMT is indicated for rCDI treatment; for other indications, it should be used only in a clinical trial setting.

FMT protocol
Some of the patients described in this article have been treated with stool from a donor familiar to them. Most of the described patients have been treated with stool from a universal donor  frozen and thawed stool from our local faecal bank. The faecal banking protocol is described in detail in our previous article[10]. Briefly, faecal material from a healthy donor is mixed with saline and glycerol and frozen at 80 . In some cases, we used the faecal suspension stored at 20 , which did not seem to affect the results or safety of FMT. The frozen suspension is thawed a few hours before FMT and collected into two 100mL syringes. When necessary, the suspension is passed through a presterilized, stainless steel tea strainer to remove larger particles.
Donor screening was performed as described in detail by Mattila et al[6] and Satokari et al[10]. Briefly, the donors were screened for hepatitis C and B, HIV, Treponema pallidum and common enteric pathogens. The donor was required to lack antibiotics for the previous six months and to present no gastrointestinal symptoms.
The preferred route of administration of FMT

The patients with rCDI underwent pretreatment with vancomycin or metronidazole, and the treatment was stopped 36 h before the FMT. In some special cases, we administered FMT during gastroscopy, injecting the suspension into the duodenum as distally as possible.
Although FMT has become the routine treatment after two relapses for CDI in our hospital, the decision to assess FMT in immunosuppressed patients and in special indications is based on a very thorough consideration, especially of safety concerns, by gast roenterologist, specialist of infectious diseases and microbiologist with FMT experience.

Thirteen patients treated with FMT for rCDI and having
significant comorbidities
In this article, we report the results of thirteen patients with major comorbidities who underwent rCDI and were treated with FMT (Table 1). Two of the patients had HIV, six were haemodialysis patients, two had a kidney transplant, two had a liver transplant and one had chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL).
Eleven of the thirteen rCDI patients (85%) treated with FMT successfully cleared the CDI. Six of the patients had major adverse events, of which two died at 2 and 5 mo postFMT; however, these events were not directly attributable to FMT. A detailed description of each patient is published online as a supplement.

Eight patients treated with FMT and not having rCDI Eight patients received FMT as an experimental form of treatment for various special indications. The patients and outcomes are compiled in Table 2 and described in detail below.

A carrier of salmonella #1
A 17yearold male was found to be a carrier of Salmonella in a routine checkup on the 1st of Septe mber 2015. He had not had previous GI symptoms. According to Finnish health authority instructions, a Salmonellapositive person may not work in food processing. The patient was about to start his studies to become a cook and Salmonella was delaying his plans.
The Salmonella strain was resistant to doxycycline and ciprofloxacin. He had a mild knee symptom that was thought to be reactive arthritis. Ciprofloxacin was administered briefly and stopped as the sensitivity results of the Salmonella became apparent. He was receiving tetracycline for acne since the 18th of August, which was stopped on the 26th of October. In October, faecal salmonella was negative twice, but it was positive again on the 16th of November.
A 2wk course of i.v. ceftriaxone was considered an

option, but the patient did not accept this treatment due to his needle phobia. A twoweek course of trimethoprim sulfadiazine 160 mg/500 mg 1 x 2 per orally was started on the 26th of November since the Salmonella strain was found to be sensitive. Unfor tunately, the faecal Salmonella test was still positive after this treatment.
On the 29th of January 2016, the patient was given FMT as described in detail in the FMT protocol section. Preceding the FMT, he received a 5d course of ceftriaxone 2 g x 1 i.m. The colonoscopy findings were normal, as well as the histology of routine biopsies. There were no complications during the procedure, but the patient fainted soon afterward, which might have been caused in part by the pain and anxiety relieving medications used during the colonoscopy. He recovered rapidly.
An upper abdomen ultrasound was performed and did not reveal any gallstones. Gallstones are a known risk factor for resistant Salmonella.
On the 9th of February  less than two weeks after FMT  the stool test was salmonellapositive and the treatment was considered a failure at first. However, the subsequent three tests (the 2nd, the 8th and the 11th of May) were all negative. According to the instructions of Finnish health authorities, the patient is conside red free from Salmonella after having three negative samples in a row, and our patient could continue his studies.
There were no reported side effects of the FMT treatment. We consider it likely that the transplanted new gut microbiota played a role in the eradication of Salmonella, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the Salmonella would have been eradicated spontaneously.

A carrier of salmonella #2
A 52yearold woman had Salmonella enteritis in

March 2016. Her symptoms ceased, but she remained a chronic carrier. She had been treated with courses of trimethoprimsulphadiatzine and amoxicillin. She had also undergone a twoweek course of intravenous ceftriaxone, but the Salmonella culture remained positive. The bacterial strain was resistant to ciproflo xacin. She was on sick leave during this time because of her work in food production. FMT treatment was administered through colonoscopy on the 17th of November 2016. Prior to FMT, a course of ceftriaxone 2 g 1 x 1 i.v. was administered for six days. The three subsequent faecal tests after FMT (the 2nd, 12th and 19th of December 2016) for Salmonella were all negative, and she could return to work. No side effects were observed.

The rationale for treating salmonella carriage with FMT The prevalence of chronic Salmonella carriage is estimated to be 2%5% in endemic areas. Symp tomless carriage of Salmonella, especially of indivi duals working in food production, is considered to be the main route of distribution of the disease among people. Furthermore, persistent carriage of Salmonella is associated with gallstones. Fluoroquinolones are the drug of choice for the treatment of chronic carriage of Salmonella[20], but strains that are resistant to ciprof loxacin pose a special challenge.
In animal models, Salmonella carriage is associated with changes in the intestinal microbiota[21]. It is not known whether people with Salmonella carriage possess alterations of the gut microbiota. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reported cases of eradication of Salmonella with FMT. FMT has been shown to reduce antibiotic resistance genes in the gut microbiota[22,23]. FMT has shown potential in eradicating faecal carriage of different multidrugresistant bacteria in case reports[24]. Therefore, changing or diversifying the intestinal microbiota through FMT is a promising

Lahtinen P et al . Fecal microbiota transplantation in special situations


new option to eradicate chronic Salmonella in cases where antibiotics have failed.

A patient with trimethylaminuria (fish malodour syndrome, TMAU) #1
A 24yearold male had been diagnosed with fish malodour syndrome (trimethylaminuria, TMAU) two years earlier, but the symptoms had started at the age of 16 years. Choline loading resulted in a TMA/TMA noxideratio of 0.43 mg/mmol creatinine (reference range 0.050.21). He had a severe odour problem, especially when sweating. He had been treated with riboflavin and activated charcoal without effect. A choline restricted diet and occasional twoweek courses of metronidazole followed by lactobacilli treatment had a slight positive effect. Copper chlorophyllin was prescribed, but he did not initiate the treatment. After metronidazole pretreatment, he was given experimental FMT through gastroscopy on the first of December 2015. Six weeks after FMT, he reported a slight reduction of the odour. Six months after the treatment, he reported fewer odour problems, but after one year, the malodour had returned to its former severity. He did not report any side effects.

A patient with TMAU #2
A 49yearold female with TMAU. Odour problems started at the age of 12 when menstruation began. The odour problem was at its worst 710 d post ovulation. The diagnosis was confirmed based on the urine TMAoxide and TMA ratio. TMAoxide was 59.1 mg/mmol creatinine (reference 17147), and TMA was
16.5 mg/mmol creatinine (reference 2.510.8) ratio 0.28 (reference 0.050.21).
She was in the perimenopausal phase with hot flashes and excess paroxysmal sweating, causing the odour problem to worsen, but it was partly in control with hormonal treatment. Twoweek metronidazole courses only helped temporarily. She had used a strict cholinerestricted diet, vitamin B2 and high doses of lactobacilli. Copper chlorophyllin and activated charcoal had been ineffective. She had previously subjectively felt less of an odour problem for a few weeks after bowel cleansing for colonoscopy. FMT was given as an experimental therapy though colonoscopy. As a pre treatment, the patient was prescribed metronidazole 400 mg three times per day for 7 d to facilitate eng raftment of the donor's microbiota. Metronidazole was stopped 36 h prior to FMT. No relief of the malodour was achieved after FMT.

The rationale for treating fish malodour syndrome with
FMT
Trimethylaminuria (TMAU) is a condition in which body odour resembles that of a dead fish. In TMAU, trimeth ylamine (TMA) accumulates in the body. Primary trimethylaminuria is genetic and caused by an inability to convert the fish smelling TMA into nonodorous

trimethylamineNoxide (TMAO) in the liver due to a deficiency of the hepatic microsomal flavincontaining monooxygenase (FMO3). Secondary TMAU is defined as an accumulation of TMA without inherited FMO3 deficiency. The aetiology of secondary TMAU is not fully known. One causal factor may be the gut microbiota, which can produce TMA through the metabolism of certain food compounds such as TMAO and choline[25]. Thus, altering TMA metabolism may be possible through manipulating the intestinal microbiota. To our knowledge, there are no previous reported cases of TMAU treated with FMT.
A cholinerestricted diet and copper chlorophyllin are the recommended treatments for TMAU[26]. Some patients experience partial relief for symptoms by using antibiotics followed by high doses of lactobacilli, riboflavin or charcoal tablets. Our hypothesis is that TMAU can be ameliorated by manipulating the gut microbiota through FMT. Some shortterm positive effects were achieved in one patient, but the bacterial spectrum of the present single FMT did not seem to be effective for the treatment of TMAU. More data concerning the effect of FMT on TMAU are needed.

A patient with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth
The patient was 66 years old in January 2015 when he received his first FMT. He had colectomy and ileal pouchanal anastomosis (IPAA) surgery in 2008 for ulcerative colitis and adenocarcinoma of the caecum. He had experienced bloating and flatulence during his adult life, but it had become worse since IPAA. He had bowel movements on average 6 times per day.
Endoscopic examination of the pouch showed no inflammation. On the small bowel passage Xray, there was a small bowel dilatation of 10 cm on the left side of the abdomen. Small bowel MRI did not show an indication for surgery.
Before FMT, the patient underwent several treat ments with inadequate results. He was treated with dietary changes and dimethicone to decrease bloating and flatulence. A probiotic  Escherichia coli (E. coli) Nissle up to 2 x 2 capsules (2.5 x 10925 x 109 CFU/ capsule) was administered to remediate dysbiosis. Antibiotics were given to decrease small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). He received a course of metronidazole and two courses of rifaximin 200 mg 1 x 4, with one course lasting two weeks and the other four weeks with a tapering dosage. He reported a slight benefit from all of these treatments, but continued to suffer from flatulence and bloating.
On the 20th of January 2015, the patient received
FMT via gastroscopy as an experimental treatment. For this treatment, 200 mL of the frozen and thawed faecal material was infused through a gastroscope deep into the descending duodenum. Biopsies were obtained via gastroscopy and revealed Helicobacter negative atrophic gastritis.
Six weeks after FMT, the patient reported that his

Lahtinen P et al . Fecal microbiota transplantation in special situations


symptoms and bowel movements decreased 50% and that the scent of his flatus was milder. The patient was considered to have reached a partial response and was scheduled for a new FMT.
The second FMT via gastroscopy was performed on the 2nd of October using the stool of the same donor as in the first FMT. This time, macrogol bowel preparation was used. The patient reported some benefit from the second treatment, but since disturbing flatulence continued, a third FMT was scheduled with a oneweek course of per oral penicillin pretreatment because the patient had previously experienced relief of his symptoms when using penicillin for a dental infection.
The third FMT via gastroscopy was performed on the 29th of January 2016. The transplant was from another donor who was an unfamiliar, tested and generally healthy person, whose stool was frozen and thawed on the day of the transplantation. The last contact with the patient was on the 21th of June 2016, i.e., five months after the third FMT. He reported having fewer symptoms, but some flatulence persisted, though with a milder scent than previously.
The patient was considered to have gained a partial response to his SIBO symptoms from these three FMT treatments.

The rationale for treating SIBO with FMT
A SIBO is defined as an increase in the number or alterations of the type of bacteria in the small bowel. It may be associated with several features, such as alterations of the small bowel anatomy, motility, and immunity, among others. Alterations of the gut microbiota are associated with SIBO by definition. SIBO causes bloating and diarrhoea. Malabsorption, malnutrition and weight loss may also be present. SIBO can most accurately be diagnosed with jejunal aspirate, but this is not widely used due to the invasiveness of the procedure[27]. Hydrogen or meth ane breath tests are used more widely, but in many centres, including our own, these tests are not in clinical use. We diagnose SIBO clinically based on symptoms and signs. Our SIBO patient had an altered GI anatomy due to a Jpouch and altered immunity due to ulcerative colitis. He received three FMTs through gastroscopy and reported reduced symptoms. For a more objective evaluation of the FMT effect on SIBO, hydrogen breath tests before and after the treatments would have been valuable. More research on the effect of FMT on SIBO is warranted.

A patient with lymphocytic colitis
A female patient who was diagnosed with microscopic colitis in 2013 at the age of 18 had diarrhoea up to 20 times per day. Faecal calprotectin was consta ntly negative. She had an inadequate response to medications  mesalamine 2.4 mg/d, budesonide 9 mg/d for two months, loperamide or fibres. She had

tried various diets to relieve the symptoms. The patient wished to be treated with FMT. For her case, there were no ongoing scientific study protocols to follow.
After repeated requests from the patient and with no other rational treatment options available, FMT through colonoscopy was administered as an experimental treatment on the 21st of June 2016.
In the followup telephone conversation on the 7th of July, the patient reported to have gained a benefit from the procedure for two weeks, after which the diarrhoea recurred as before. The outcome was considered negative and no further transplants were given.

The rationale for treating lymphocytic colitis with FMT Lymphocytic colitis is a subtype of microscopic colitis. It is a cause of diarrhoea that is more common in elderly people, but it may even affect children. Microscopic colitis may be associated with an altered gut microbiota. In a small study, patients with microscopic colitis had a decrease in Akkermansia species compared with the healthy controls. Akkermansia is considered to have a protective effect on the intestinal epithelium[28,29]. Our patient with lymphocytic colitis was treated once with FMT through colonoscopy. She experienced shortterm (two weeks) relief of her symptoms, after which the symptoms recurred. The outcome was considered negative. In possible future studies, it might be worth considering a recurrent treatmentprotocol with FMT, which has shown some promising results in IBD patients[30,31] and in a single case of collagenous colitis[32], as well as pretreatment with antibiotics prior to FMT, which may facilitate engraftment of the donor's microbiota[5].

A 32yearold woman was treated with FMT for being a chronic carrier of norovirus. As a longterm diagnosis, she had common variable immunodeficiency (CVI), coeliac disease and osteoporosis. She had chronic diarrhoea since 2009, malabsorption since 2012 and partial parenteral nutrition since March 2015. Her norovirus infection was diagnosed in September 2013. Previously, she did not have acute gastroenteritis. Several medications for her norovirus infection had been attempted without success: interferon alfa, interferon with ribavirin and nitazoxsanide.
FMT was administered in March 2016 through gastroscopy. She was susceptible to bacterial infections due to CVI and bronchiectasis. She had received trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole as a longterm pro phylactic treatment, which was ceased 36 h before FMT. Bowel lavage was not administered prior to FMT. Routine biopsies of the gastroscopy revealed partial villus atrophy.
After FMT, the symptoms of the patient remained unchanged, with four to six bowel movements per day.

Faecal norovirus remained positive. Thus, the patient did not benefit from the experimental FMT treatment. No side effects related to the FMT were observed.

Rationale for treating chronic norovirus infection with FMT
Approximately 5% of CVI patients have enteropathy. In some case reports, chronic norovirus infection has been the cause of CVIassociated enteropathy, and eradication of the virus has cured the symptoms. It has even been hypothesized that chronic norovirus could be a key player in most of these cases[33].
It is suspected that the gut microbiota plays a role in regulating norovirus infection and its pathogenesis[34], and the relationship between the gut bacteria and norovirus infection is undergoing active analysis using murine models. We did not find any published cases of chronic norovirus or CVI enteropathy treated with FMT, and to our knowledge, the patient presented herein is the first reported case.

A carrier of ESBL-producing E. coli

tested antibiotics. She was treated with a two and a half day course of nitrofurantoin 75 mg twice a day.

The rationale for treating ESBL-producing E. coli carriage with FMT
Antibiotic resistance is an emerging global health problem. One of the most common and clinically rele vant types of antibioticresistant bacteria are the ESBL producing enterobacteria, especially E. coli, which occurs worldwide[35]. Antibiotic resistance is largely caused by excessive use of wide spectrum antibiotics. We, among other authors, have reported the reduction of antibiotic resistance genes in the intestinal micro biome of patients with rCDI after FMT[22,23].
FMT has been successfully used for the eradication of ESBLproducing E. coli and other multidrug resistant bacteria in a small number of published case reports[3638]. Clinical use of FMT for eradicating resistant bacteria requires further study in larger groups of patients.

DISCUSSION

A 31yearold female patient with asthma was a	 	

carrier of the multidrugresistant E. coliextended spectrum betalactamase producing strain (ESBL). She had received pyelophritis caused by ESBLproducing
E. coli two times, in October 2015 and June 2016. Both episodes of pyelonephritis had been treated with intravenous ertapenem. The duration of the second ertapenem treatment was ten days.
She had studied scientific literature concerning ESBL and E. coli virulence factors. After her second pyelonephritis, a consultant infectious disease specialist recommended ESBL eradication with FMT. Prior to FMT, faecal cultures for ESBLproducing E. coli were collected five times between August 2016 and February 2017. All the cultures were positive with ESBLproducing E. coli.
The E. coli strain was resistant to amoxicillin clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cephalexin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, levofloxacin and trimethoprimsulfam ethoxazole, susceptible to ertapenem, meropenem, tobramycin, fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin and showed intermediate susceptibility to ceftazidime and piper acillintazobactam.
The patient was hospitalized for meningitis in November 2016. She was treated with ceftriaxone and acyclovir. The meningitis was shown to be caused by an enterovirus. She recovered fully, but the episode delayed her FMT treatment.
FMT was performed via colonoscopy on the 31st of
January 2017. The endoscopic finding was normal, as were the routine biopsies. Six weeks later, on the 20th of March, the faecal culture of ESBLproducing E. coli was negative. The patient had symptoms of cystitis, and the urine test showed elevated  leukocytes  and
E. coli, but this time they were susceptible to all the

We report the results obtained for 21 FMTtreated patients; thirteen of the patients had rCDI with a significant underlying comorbidity, and eight of the patients had a condition other than rCDI. The 21 reviewed patients consisted of a heterogeneous group with many comorbidities. This establishes a limitation to our study; definitive conclusions cannot be drawn for the patients as a group. The strength of our study is that we review real life patients who are often excluded from studies due to their comorbidities.
There remains a paucity of data about FMT treat ments of patients with different comorbidities. In particular, immunocompromised patients have been excluded from many studies due to the suspected risk of infectious complications. Published data from case series to date suggest that FMT is acceptably safe and effective, even for immunocompromised patients[11,12,39].
Of our thirteen patients with rCDI, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) was successfully eradicated from eleven patients. Of those eleven, a patient with HIV and alcoholism experienced reinfection four months after FMT. One patient had gastroenteritis symptoms three days after the FMT and took vancomycin for two days without consulting a doctor. Faecal C. difficile was not tested. Her CDI relapses before FMT had been severe. There were no relapses of CDI documented over 8 mo of followup, and thus the outcome was considered positive. Two patients experienced a relapse, of which one had received antibiotics less than a week after FMT.
At one month of followup after FMT, two of the thirteen rCDI patients had relapsed. Two of the patients were hospitalized due to infections that were

not related to FMT. Two dialysis patients had sepsis in the months following FMT. One dialysis patient died two months after FMT. A patient with CLL and chronic norovirus did not clear the CDI or norovirus; she died due to complications of CLL five months after FMT. The HIV patient resolved the C. difficile infection through FMT but experienced an activation of underlying ulcerative colitis two months after FMT. The patient group had many comorbidities, and all the adverse events were considered likely to be unrelated to the FMT.
We also report eight cases of patients treated with FMT for a reason other than rCDI. These patients had prolonged Salmonella infection (two cases), ESBL producing E. coli carriage, fish malodour syndrome (two cases), chronic norovirus infection, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and lymphocytic colitis. The acknowledged indication for FMT is recurrent C. difficile infection. When performed outside of this indication, FMT should preferably be conducted in a clinical trial setting[19]. However, experimental treatment in carefully considered cases is justified when other treatment options are limited. Such cases also provide preliminary results regarding the use of a specific treatment for new indications.
In the past few years, an increasing number of diseases have been shown to be associated with alterations of the gut microbiota, yet the causality is in most cases undefined. FMT has been suggested to be investigated in many of these diseases[14]. Although promising data about FMT in new indications such as autism[40], constipation[41] and epilepsy[42] have been reported, careful consideration of the associated risks is necessary.
The eight patients treated for causes other than rCDI all had a condition in which disruption of the gut microbiota was a possible etiological factor. All eight patients expressed a strong wish to try FMT for their condition, for which other treatments had previously failed. The patients were informed of the experimental nature of the procedure. The justification of each treatment was considered by at least three specialists, including the performing gastroenterologist, the referring physician and the head of the Gastro enterology Department.
The carriers of Salmonella and ESBLproducing E. coli, and the SIBO patient seemed to have benefitted from FMT. One of the fish malodour syndrome patients received only shortterm relief for malodour, and the other did not gain any benefit. The patient suffering from lymphocytic colitis and the CVI patient with chronic norovirus infection did not gain a benefit from FMT. The positive outcome of the carriers of Salmonella and ESBLproducing E. coli was objectively defined with a laboratory test, as was the negative outcome for the norovirus patient. The outcomes of the other three patients was based on selfreported symptoms

and thus were less objective. None of these patients reported any side effects.
The eradication of antibiotic resistant bacteria with FMT has been studied by many research groups, and the results to date are promising. Successful eradications have been described with several multidrugresistant bacteria, such as ESBLproducing and carbapenemaseproducing Enterobacteriaceae, vancomycinresistant Enterococci, or methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus[3638]. To the best of our knowledge, the two eradications of Salmonella carriage are the first reported cases. The efficacy of FMT for chronic norovirus infection and fish malodour syndrome has also not been reported previously. The treatment options for multidrugresistant organisms are scarce  eradication and increasing colonization resistance by FMT may offer a new means to counter the problem.
We think it necessary to further study the effect of FMT in conditions where other treatment options are limited. Placebocontrolled trials should be preferred due to the high risk of a placebo effect in conditions in which the diagnosis relies mostly on symptoms, although randomized controlled trials may not be an option for infrequent conditions due to the small number of patients. Thus, case series provide valuable guidance for clinical practice and future clinical trials.
In conclusion, in our cohort, FMT appeared to be a safe and effective treatment for rCDI for patients with significant comorbidities, although further conclusions cannot be drawn due to the small sample size. FMT also shows promise for the eradication of antibiotic resistant bacteria, for which further research is warranted. FMT is only indicated for rCDI; for other indications, FMT should still be performed only in a clinical trial setting.



Case characteristics
The authors reviewed 21 fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)-treated patients, of which 13 had recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI)  and major comorbidities: two human immunodeficiency virus patients, six haemodialysis patients, two kidney transplant patients, two liver transplant patients and a patient with chronic lymphatic leukaemia. In addition, the authors reviewed 8 patients treated with FMT for new indications: Salmonella carriage (two patients), trimethylaminuria (two patients), small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, lymphocytic colitis, ESBL-producing Escherichia coli carriage and a common variable immunodeficiency-patient with chronic norovirus infection.

Treatment
The patients were treated with FMT. Most of the patients received FMT via colonoscopy, and stool from a universal donor was mainly used. In a minority of cases, FMT was administered through gastroscopy.

Related reports
Immunocompromised patients have been excluded from the majority of FMT studies, but case reports and series have started to emerge. The number of case reports of patients treated with FMT for indications other than Clostridium

difficile is growing. To our knowledge, eradication of Salmonella carriage with FMT has not been reported previously.

Experiences and lessons
FMT is acceptably safe for the treatment of rCDI in immunocompromised patients. FMT is promising as a treatment for the eradication of antibiotic- resistant bacteria. There is a great demand for further research on FMT for many new indications.

Peer-review
This article gives a clear description of 21 cases and reasonable discussion, and it can provide a good reference in the daily performance of FMT. The case description in the article is very detailed, the analysis is also very thorough. The article has a good clinical significance.
