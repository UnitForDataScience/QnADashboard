Objective: Galactomannans derived from fenugreek confer known health benefits; however, there is little information regarding health benefits of citrus pectin (CP) and its association with gut microbiome metabolites. The aim of this study was to examine links between galactomannan and CP consumption, microbiota development, and glucose metabolism.
Design: Male C57 BL/6 J mice ages 7 to 8 wk were fed ad libitum with a normal diet or one sup- plemented with 15% of either galactomannan or CP. At 3 wk, an oral glucose tolerance test was performed. Animals were sacrificed at 4 wk and relevant organs were harvested.
Results: Fiber enrichment led to reductions in weight gain, fasting glucose levels, and total serum cholesterol (P < 0.05). Compared with mice fed the normal diet, microbiota populations were altered in both fiber groups and were found  to be richer in Bacteroidetes rather than  Firmicutes   (P < 0.05). The modification was significantly greater in galactomannan-fed than in CP-fed mice  (P < 0.0001). Also, enhanced levels of the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) propionate were found in the cecal contents of CP-fed animals (P < 0.05). Protein expression levels of monocarboxylate transporter 1, which may promote transport of SCFA, were measured in the large intestines after fiber consumption. Enhanced adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation was observed in livers of galactomannan-fed mice (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Consumption of diets containing soluble fibers, as used in this study, resulted in gut microbiota comprising a healthier flora, and led to positive effects on weight, glycemic control, and liver b oxidation via AMPK.

The gut microbiota plays an important role in human health via numerous mechanisms that include enhancing efficiency of energy harvesting from the diet through metabolism of non- digestible dietary components, and maintaining immune

homeostasis . The human colon biota is dominated primarily by two bacterial phyla, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, which represent >90% of all the gut phylotypes. Bacteria such as Fae- calibacterium prausnitzii and Eubacterium rectale are commonly considered to be health enhancing and are involved in fiber fermentation that produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) . It was found that aberrant gut microbiota composition is asso- ciated with metabolic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis , and it is clear that the type and quantity of food components that reach the colon have an important effect on microbiota composition and activity .

Dietary fiber is thought to play a protective role against development of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and obesity , and furthermore, fiber, which is the main energy source for the gut microbiota, supports production of the SCFAs, butyrate, acetate, and propionate . SCFAs were found to improve various features of energy metabolism under both insulin-sensitive and insulin-insensitive conditions, through stimulation of intestinal gluconeogenesis. Propionate also was shown to directly initiate a gut-brain neural circuit that has beneficial effects on host physiology .
One of the regulators for glucose metabolism in the liver is activated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which inhibits acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) activity and leads to a decrease of lipogenesis . AMPK is acti- vated by various factors, one of which is thought to be SCFA propionate. Similarly, adiponectin is also known to activate AMPK, and two independent pathways were identified . These and other recent findings indicate that dietary manipulation by supplementation with dietary fiber has considerable potential for modifying the population of human colonic microbiota, and thereby potentially imparting health benefits .
Pectin, derived from citrus, is a gelling agent that on reaching the colon is fermented by the gut microbiota to form SCFA . Fenugreek potentially offers benefits in preventing and treating a number of diseases such as diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and inflammation . Neelakantan et al.  conducted a meta-analysis that revealed a strong association between fenu- greek intake and hypoglycemic effects in patients with diabetes, and Hassan et al. found that a methanolic extract of fenu- greek regulated inflammation via modulation of nuclear fac- tor-kB. One of the major chemical constituents identified as an active contributor to principle health effects is the fiber fraction of galactomannan. In light of the potential therapeutic roles of both galactomannan (G) and citrus pectin (CP), the functional food industry commonly refers to them as nutraceuticals.
The aim of the present study was to assess the potential capability of soluble fibers to improve glucose metabolism and to change gut microbiota populations in mice. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there is little available information on the metabolic effects of CP and G, and the present study represents the first attempt to assess the phylotypes of microbiota that developed after consumption of these sources of dietary fiber.

Materials and methods

Experimental animals, diets, and sample collection

All experiments were performed within the guidelines of the Authority for Biological and Biomedical Models, and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care Ethics Committee, both of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
Male C57 BL/6 J mice, 7 to 8 wk old, were purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Jerusalem, Israel). Mice (N 1/4 31) were randomly assigned to one of three groups that were fed a normal diet (ND) or one of two fiber-enriched diets, designated CP and G, respectively. The ND was based on the AIN-93 M diet, with a few modi- fications; the fiber-enriched diets were based on ND with the addition of 15% (w/
w) of either fenugreek G or CP (). The mice were housed in a controlled environment (12/12 h light/dark cycle, 18-24o C) with ad libitum access to food and water. The total energy-content difference between the ND and the fiber-
enriched diets was 136 kcalda 3.5% difference. The mouse chow in all three diets was prepared in our laboratory, and included the fiber additives. To main- tain equal levels of total energy and chow weight in the fiber diets and the ND it was necessary to reduce other ingredients (for more details, see  ). Citrus pectin (supplied by Strauss, Achihood, Israel) contained in- gredients supplied by Herbafood Ingredients (Werder, Germany). Fenugreek G was supplied by Frutarom (Haifa, Israel).
After the mice received the diets for 2 wk, feces were collected from each cage and weighed. After 3 wk on the diets, the mice were fasted for 12 h and subjected to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).

* Diet composition per kg; fibers were fenugreek galactomannan or citrus pectin.

Before the OGTT, the mice were weighed and marked and were given D- glucose (3 g/kg body weight) by gavage. Glucose levels were monitored at 0, 30, 60, and 120 min after glucose loading; a glucometer was used to measure glucose levels in blood drawn from the tail tip.
After 4 wk on experimental diets, the mice were fasted for 12 h, their body weights were recorded, and they were sacrificed in random order by isoflurane overdose. Blood was collected from the vena cava, and plasma was obtained by
centrifugation at 5000g at 4o C for 10 min, and stored at -20oC. Epididymal adipose
tissue was removed, weighed, placed in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -75o C. Liver tissue was collected and weighed; a small sample from the right lobe was placed in
4% formaldehyde, and the remaining liver tissue was minced in liquid nitrogen and stored at -75o C. Intestines  were  collected, weighed,  and placed on ice. The  ceca were  separated from the large intestines and their contents were collected for
microbiota analysis. The ceca and large intestines were rinsed in cold saline. A small piece of each was placed in 4% formaldehyde, and the remaining tissues were placed in liquid nitrogen and stored at -75oC. The brains were removed and the
hypothalamus was separated, placed in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -75o C.

Blood parameters

Analyses of plasma lipid profiles were performed by American Laboratories (Herzliya, Israel) and the results are presented in . Con- centrations of plasma insulin were determined with an RIA kit (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA). The intra- and interassay coefficients of variation for the insulin assay were 7.2% and 5.1%, respectively.

Histologic examination

Histologic slides were prepared by Patholab (Rehovot, Israel). Tissues were macrodissected, placed in plastic cassettes, and dehydrated. The dehydrated sam- ples were embedded in paraffin blocks by an automatic apparatus. The paraffin blocks were sectioned at w3 to 5 mm and placed on glass slides, which then were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and covered by an automatic apparatus. The histopathological examination was performed by Prof. A. Nyska.
Histopathological changes were described and scored by the study pathol- ogist, according to a semiquantitative scale: 0 1/4 no lesion; 1 1/4 minimal change; 2 1/4 mild change;3 1/4 moderate change; and 4 1/4 marked change. Concurrently with histopathological evaluation, the findings in each treated animal were compared with those in a control animal to validate any putative treatment-related effects.

SCFA analyses

Acidified water at pH 2.0 to 3.0 was added to 50-mg samples of cecum contents in a proportion of 1:10. Samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 17 000g at 4o C for 20 min, the upper phase was collected and SCFA levels were assessed with a 5890 Series 2 gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) equipped with a capillary column (30 m x 0.53 mm x 0.5 mm i.d.; Agilent Tech- nologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a flame ionization detector. The injection port, column, and detector were maintained at 175, 130, and 165o C, respectively.

Protein extraction and western blotting

Total protein was extracted from tissues with lysis buffer containing: 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 145 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5%



NP-40, 100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 200 mM NaVO4, 5 mM NaF, and 1% protease inhibitor  cocktail.  Lysates  were  centrifuged  at  20  000g  for  15 min, and the protein concentration was determined by Bradford method with bovine serum albumin used as a standard. The samples were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel (7.5-10%) electrophoresis, after which pro- teins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were incubated with primary antibodies: antirabbit AMPK, phosphrylated adenosine mono- phosphate-activated protein kinase (pAMPK) (Thr-172; Cell Signaling Technol- ogy, Beverly, MA, USA), monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 1 (Novus Biologicals,
Littleton, CO, USA), and antimouse b-actin (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and
then, after several washes, with secondary goat antibodies (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA). AdipoR1 and R2 were detected by using primary antibodies (Novus Biological, Littleton, CO, USA; and Proteintech group, Inc, Rosemont, IL, USA respectively). The secondary antibodies used for AdipoR1 were donkey antibodies and for AdipoR2 were goat antibodies. The immune reaction was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence,  with  bands  being quantified by densitometry and expressed as arbitrary units.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction

Total RNA was isolated by using Tri-Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, Rehovot, Israel), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Complementary DNA was  prepared  with the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Quanta BioSciences, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was per- formed with the 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), with specific primers. Quantitative changes in gene expression were determined by normalizing against 18 S mRNA.

Preparation of 16 S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons for the Illumina system

To study the effect of each diet on the gut microbiome, the prokaryotic 16 S ribosomal RNA gene (16 S rRNA) was analyzed; it is w1500 bp long and contains

nine variable regions interspersed among conserved regions. These variable re- gions were subjected to phylogenetic classification according to genus or species, in diverse microbial populations. The following protocol describes a two-step PCR-based method for preparing samples for sequencing the variable V3 and V4 regions of the 16 S rRNA gene. Bacterial DNA was extracted from the studied mice with the PureLink Genomic DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen, Paisley, Scotland). Each sample then was quantified with a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and diluted to a final concentration of 5 ng/mL in
10 mM Tris at pH 8.5. The 16 S library preparation was carried out as described in Illumina's 16 S sample preparation guide with minor modificationsdthe  Pri-  meStar HS DNA polymerase premix (Takara-Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) was used instead of the PCR enzyme.

Statistical analysis

Values are presented as means +- SE. Analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) and the Tukey-Kramer honest significant difference post hoc test were used to compare means. The significance level was P < 0.05 for all analyses. The JMP 7.0.2 and JMP 11 Pro software suites (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) were used for the analyses.

Results

Body weight, epididymal adipose tissue weight, and glucose tolerance

Enrichment of ND with 15% (w/w) of CP or G fiber led to reduced weight gain. By week 2, and continuing into week 3, the average weight of mice consuming the fiber-enriched diets was lower than that of ND-treated mice (A). On the day of sac- rifice, epididymal adipose tissue was removed and weighed. Its

weight was lower among mice that received fiber-enriched diets than among those that received ND (B).
Fasting levels of glucose were lower in the CP and G mice than in the ND group (C). Both fiber-enriched diets led to improved glucose tolerance, as indicated by the OGTT results at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min, but no intergroup differences in blood serum insulin levels were observed (data not shown).

Intestinal contents and SCFA levels as affected by various fibers, after fiber fermentation

Intestinal histology revealed healthy morphology, and no abnormalities were detected among the various groups (data not shown).

Weights of intestines and intestinal contents were signifi- cantly higher in group G than in CP and ND, and were higher in CP than in ND (A, B).
Group average weights of feces were 1.2	0.2, 2.6	0.2, and
1.1	0.2 g for ND, CP, and G, respectively.
The SCFA levels in cecal contents differed among the groups. Acetate formed a higher proportion of the total SCFA in ND than in G (C); the concentration of propionate was higher in CP than in ND (D), and that of butyrate was higher in CP than in G (E).

Intestinal MCT1 protein expression

membrane after fiber fermentation, and MCT1 protein levels in long intestines were higher in CP than in ND mice ().

Alterations in gut microbiota following fiber enrichment

Classification by phylum showed the highest percentage of Bacteroidetes and lowest percentage of Firmicutes in fiber-fed groups, especially in animals fed galactomannans (A, B). Classification according to genus showed that the number of counts of Prevottela was greater among G mice than ND animals (C).

Liver response to fiber enrichment

Histologic examination did not reveal liver damage that could be attributed to fiber consumption. One of the principal morphologic criteriada fatty changedwas noted in only two animals: one ND mouse and one from the CP group. The severity of this lesion was comparable in the two animals; therefore, this change was considered to be an incidental, spontaneous occur- rence, unrelated to the tested compounds. In fact, fatty change occasionally is reported as an incidental finding in untreated mice of the same age and strain ( and )
Measurement of AMPK protein expression in liver, regarded as an indicator () showed the ratio of pAMPK to AMPK to be significantly higher in G than in ND mice.

Adiponectin receptor expression

AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 mRNA levels were measured in liver tissue. There were significantly higher levels of both in livers of G-fed mice ().
Protein levels were evaluated by Western blot analysis. Adi- poR2 expression level was reduced by 40% compared with the control, following supplementation with the G-rich diet. There was no effect on AdipoR1 expression (). Pectin had no sig- nificant effect on the expression level of any of the adiponectin receptors (). The AdipoR1 protein in the liver does not appear to be noticeable. It is known that this receptor is mainly expressed in muscle .

Discussion

Beneficial effects of enrichment of mice diets with soluble fibers CP and G were observed. C57 BL/6 J mice were chosen as the model to compare a condition of normal healthy fiber con- sumption with one of very low fiber consumption. These particular fibers were chosen because CP may be used as a thickener in the food industry, and G is sold as a hypoglycemic agent; both are known to modulate gut microbiota and to affect metabolic parameters related to glucose metabolism.
Enriching the diet with fiber was found to enhance the di- versity of the gut microbiota, and different diets were associated with differing bacterial populations. At the phylum level, it was

found that the highest and lowest levels of Firmicutes were in ND and G mice, respectively, whereas the highest and lowest levels of Bacteroidetes were in G and ND mice, respectively. Although results vary among studies, increases in Firmicutes and decreases in Bacteroidetes were commonly associated with obesity . Kovatcheva-Datchary et al.  reported an increase in Bacter- oidetes in fiber-fed mice; at the genus level, they found that levels of Prevotella also were elevated. Prevotella was found to improve glucose metabolism in mice, and in the present study, elevated levels of Prevotella were observed in mice fed with G (C).
The present results showed that enrichment with G led to reduced body weight gain in mice. This finding is consistent with the observed increases in fasting glucose levels and glucose tolerance (A-C). Fenugreek previously was known to have antidiabetic activity, to lower plasma cholesterol levels, to in- crease antioxidant activity, and to exhibit antiinflammatory properties , and in the present study, CP was observed to elicit a similar but weaker effect. Although improved glucose levels were observed, insulin levels did not differ among the fiber-fed groups; this may strengthen the hypothesis that different mechanisms were acting.
We found that G strongly increased the ratio of Bacteroidetes
to Firmicutes, and observed a similar but weaker effect among

CP-fed mice. Differing influence levels were recorded for the respective fibers, most likely because of differing chemical con- stituents. It was reported elsewhere that microbiome growth on fiber from different sources led to differing fiber-degradation pathways . These findings indicate how metabolism of di- etary fiber may be mediated by niche species, which presents immediate fundamental and practical implications regarding the gut symbiont population, in the context of nutrition and health. This effect appears to differ among fibers from different sources, and it is important to point out that the high levels of dietary fiber consumption used in the present study had no damaging effects on the gut and liver tissues, which was confirmed by histologic examination ().
During week 2 of the present study, when feces were collected, it was found that inclusion of CP fibers in the diet more than doubled the amount of fecal material. This finding matches what already was known of fibers' capacity to regulate and enhance bowel movements . Similar results were expected with G enrichment, but no increase in fecal mass was observed. Examination of the large intestine contents and weight showed that fibers, especially G, led to increases of both intestinal weight and contents, which indicates that although both fibers are sol- uble they appear to be metabolized differently by the gut

microbiome, with differing levels of fermentation and reab- sorption, which could lead to differing effects on fecal mass.
There were interactions among dietary fiber, microbiota, and SCFAs. Dietary fiber degradation altered the microbial composi- tion, increased SCFA production, and lowered the luminal pH . Many previous experimental studies of the effects of SCFAs involved feeding with specific SCFAs and tracing their move- ments and effects. We sought to administer relatively high per- centages of fibers to ensure fermentation that would lead to a traceable effect, but without injury to the GI tract; and the latter aim was confirmed by the histologic examination. It is also worthwhile to mention that a large amount of dietary  fiber  might alter the viscosity of the gut contents, and restrict the postprandial response mainly to reducing levels of lipids and glucose ().
The present study demonstrated the effects of G and CP on the three main SCFAsdacetate, propionate, and butyratedand tested for various effects on peripheral organs. Acetate formed

the highest concentration in all experimental groups and although its levels were significantly lower in the G-fed group than in the ND-fed one, they still remained high. It was shown by other researchers that acetate may reduce appetite via a central homeostatic mechanism ; also, SCFAs were shown to bind to G protein-coupled receptors in the gastrointestinal tract and on other tissues , and such binding to receptors may lead to varied effects. Indeed, further study is needed to link microbiota to metabolic effects. Nevertheless, our data provide evidence that metabolic changes could be related to changes in gut microbiota. Therefore, gut microbiota compo- sition at the species level is related to body weight  and glucose, which might be of relevance for using of G derived from fenugreek and CP for the management of obesity. Possible mechanisms linking the gut microbiota to glucose homeostasis may include increased changes in the production of SCFAs as seen in the present study and supported by earlier findings .

Pectin degradation led to increased butyrate and propionate levels that were shown to protect against diet-induced obesity . The mechanism of butyrate action is related to promotion of energy expenditure and induction of mitochondria function and lead to increase the insulin sensitivity as reported previously .
It also was shown how SCFAs formed in the colon are ionized and transported to the blood system, via passive diffusion, with proteins such as MCT1 . Thus, it is possible that SCFA uptake occurs via nonionic diffusion .
In the present study, protein expression of MCT1 was found in all groups; however, although the levels were elevated in G compared with those in ND, they were significantly highest in CP (). This finding suggests that the fiber-enriched diets can facilitate enhanced delivery of SCFAs from the mouse gastroin- testinal tract to internal organs such as the liver. With regard to propionate and butyrate levels, there were some differences among groups: The highest concentration of propionate was produced in CP mice, and levels were significantly higher than in ND. G increased the propionate but to less extent compared to CP. Propionate also might affect pAMPK and MCT1 indirectly. Butyrate levels were significantly lower in G mice than in CP.
No intergroup differences were found in CNS levels of the mRNA of appetite-regulating hormonesdpro-opionmelanocortin

(POMC), agouti-related peptide (AgRP), and neuropeptide Y (NPY) d(), possibly because all groups received high levels of acetate. Hence, it is possible that in the present study, the effecton bodyweightwas not due to centralnervoussystem satiety signaling; nevertheless, this hypothesis requires further elucidation.
Our findings regarding the effects of dietary fiber on expres- sion of adiponectin receptors in the liver demonstrated that G led to increased mRNA of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, but protein expression, and especially that of AdipoR2, was decreased. This could be attributed to a possible induction by C of receptor internalization, which resulted, in turn, in a reduction of protein expression and led, at the same time, to increased mRNA syn- thesis . Overall, the present results may indicate that dietary fibers (G) diminished the effect of adiponectin receptors in the liver () .
It was shown elsewhere that SCFA butyrate was associated with adiponectin expression , so perhaps fermentation of G by the microbiota population led to butyrate levels that pro- moted this effect. Unfortunately, because of limited availability of serum, adiponectin levels were not measured in the present study.
Our previous work has shown that dietary fibers such as fenugreek have affected the circulation of bile salts . It is



quite possible that the soluble dietary fiber we used in this study improved the glucose tolerance test and processes involved in glucose metabolism via bile salts. Bile salts were found to be signaling receptors involved in glucose and homeostasis .

Conclusions

Dietary fibersdpectin and galactomannandderived from citrus and fenugreek, respectively, modified the gut microbiota population profile in a positive sense and, at the same time, reduced body weight, improved glycemic control, and increased liver b oxidation. Additionally, we would like to highlight the differing effects on gut microbiota and metabolism that can be induced by fibers derived from different sources, as demon- strated in the present study.
Finally, we must emphasize that better understanding of the mechanisms linking the gut microbiome to glucose metabolism, and of the relevant compositional and functional characteristics of the gut microbiome would help to guide future research into development of targeted dietary approaches.

Diet intake and consumption:

All mice were fed ad lib. During the study food consumption was recorded twice and there were no significant differences (Tukey-Kramer) between the groups 3.6 0.1; 3.3 0.12; and
3.7 0.1 g/d, for normal, galactomannan and pectin diet, respectively. We believe that food consumption did not affect our results and discussion.
Regarding the fat content, we tried to minimize the differ- ences between all three diets while on the other hand, try to resemble a physiological state were consuming more fiber comes an account of other nutrients. As such, we tried to replace mostly the carbohydrates. Please see the table below that elaborates on the diet composition.

Effect of fiber diets on lipid profile

Total cholesterol in serum was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in fiber fed groups compared to ND. No difference was spotted between the groups for triglyceride levels. HDL levels were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in ND compared to G.




Supplementary Table 1
Diet composition as can be seen the diet composition had no significant differ- ences between all diet used. We kept minimum differences between all three diets by replacing mainly the carbohydrates











Supplementary Fig. 1. Findings of serum plasma lipid profile. On the day of sac- rifice, blood was drawn from the vena cava, serum plasma was used for lipid profile analyses. All values are means +- SE, n 1/4 6. Graphs marked with different letters (a, b) are signi cantly different (P < 0.05) (ND - normal diet, G - galactomannan, CP - citrus pectin).

Effect of fiber diets on liver histology

































Supplementary Fig. 2. Histological findings of the liver. Each treated animal was concurrently compared to a control animal, in order to verify any potential treatment related effects. Mild differences were detected between livers in groups. A. Section of the animal liver from group ND - Arrow indicates a single inflammatory cell infiltration. B. Section of the liver from group G - Yellow arrow indicates a single cell hepatocytic cell necrosis (apoptosis). A blue arrow indicates hepatocytic mitosis (i.e., regenerative hyperplasia associated with the cell necrosis). C. Yellow arrows indicate hepatocytic cytoplasmic vacuolation. n 1/4 4. (ND normal diet, G galactomannan, CP citrus pectin). According to the pathologist professional judgement, the selected magnifications are the most appropriate to demonstrate the type of changes shown and explained in the photos and text.



Supplementary Table 2
Histological findings. Histopathological changes were scored by the study pathologist, using semi-quantitative grading of five grades (0-4), taking into consideration the severity of the changes (0 1/4 No Lesion, 1 1/4 Minimal Change, 2 1/4 Mild Change, 3 1/4 Moderate Change, 4 1/4 Marked Change). (ND normal diet, G galactomannan, CP citrus pectin)


Effect of fiber diets on mRNA gene expression in the brain






























Supplementary Fig. 3. Brain regulation for appetite and satiety. No difference was found among mRNA levels of POMC, AgRP and NPY in the hypothalamus of mice from all three. All values are means +- SE, n 1/4 7-10. (ND normal diet, G galactomannan, CP citrus pectin).
