Abstract
Severe radiation exposure may cause acute radiation syndrome, a possibly fatal condition requiring effective therapy. Gut microbiota can be manipulated to fight against many diseases. We explored whether intestinal microbe transplantation could alleviate radia- tion-induced toxicity. High-throughput sequencing showed that gastrointestinal bacterial community composition  differed between male and female mice and was associated with suscepti- bility to radiation toxicity. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) increased the survival rate of irradiated animals, elevated periph- eral white blood cell counts and improved gastrointestinal tract function and intestinal epithelial integrity in irradiated male and female mice. FMT preserved the intestinal bacterial composition and retained mRNA and long non-coding RNA expression profiles of host small intestines in a sex-specific fashion. Despite promoting angiogenesis, sex-matched FMT did not accelerate the prolifera- tion of cancer cells in vivo. FMT might serve as a therapeutic to mitigate radiation-induced toxicity and improve the prognosis of tumour patients after radiotherapy.

Introduction
Radiation exposure in a mass casualty setting is a serious military and public health concern (Taniguchi et al, 2014). Exposure to a high dose of irradiation in a short time is associated with bone marrow toxicity (haematopoietic syndrome) and gastrointestinal (GI)


toxicity (GI syndrome), which are collectively known as acute radia- tion syndrome (ARS; Kirsch et al, 2010; Leibowitz et al, 2014). ARS may facilitate an intractable pathologic process and even cause even- tual death (Lee et al, 2014). In addition, mounting clinical evidence has shown the bone marrow and small intestine epithelium to be the major sites of injury during radiation therapy, owing to their higher sensitivity to ionizing radiation (Ciorba et al, 2012). Radiation- mediated toxicity, especially radiation-induced gastrointestinal  injury, is a medical problem that urgently needs effective therapy.
The GI tract has the unique property of harbouring numerous microbes within the lumen, most of which are bacteria that have co-evolved with  the  host  in  a  mutualistic  relationship  (Kamada  et al, 2013). Recently, investigations focusing on gut  microbiota have experienced a renaissance, and growing evidence supports a pivotal role of intestinal microbes as key regulatory  elements  in  their host's physiologic and pathologic status (Ostaff et al,  2013). For example, intestinal microbes govern metabolic function and energy balance, and flora disequilibrium is deemed to contribute to the development of numerous metabolic diseases (Amar et al, 2011; Nieuwdorp et al, 2014). Intestinal microbes  are  continuously shaping the development of their host's immune system, directly modulating the innate and adaptive immune responses (Sommer & Backhed, 2013; Barroso-Batista et al, 2015). Epidemiological studies reveal that the intestinal microbiome engages in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with characteristic shifts in the composition of the intestinal microbiota, reinforcing the view that IBD results from altered interactions between  intestinal  microbes and the mucosal immune system (Kostic et al, 2014).  Germ-free mice and faecal transplant research demonstrate that changes in the microbiota are necessary and sufficient for both low-grade inflammation and metabolic syndrome (Chassaing et al, 2015). Moreover, marked shifts in bacterial communities in the gut are inextricably intertwined with the development of diet-associated cancer (Schulz et al, 2014; Feng et al, 2015; Gorjifard & Goldszmid, 2015), suggesting that enteral bacteria might be used as diagnostic biomarkers for many cancers. However, the relationship between

enteric bacteria and the radiosensitivity of hosts is unknown; more- over, whether intestinal microbes can be used to mitigate radiation- induced injury remains undocumented.
In the present study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential and molecular mechanisms of faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in a rodent model of lethal irradiation and demonstrated that trans- plantation of enteric microbes from healthy mice remarkably miti- gated radiation-induced GI syndrome in a sex-dependent fashion. More importantly, FMT retained the mRNA and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression profiles of the small intestine. Thus, our findings provide new insights into the function and underlying protective mechanism of intestinal microbiota transplant in the

context of radiation-induced toxicity in a preclinical experimental setting.


Results
Intestinal bacterial communities are associated with radiosensitivity in a mouse model

To determine the relationship between  the  intestinal  bacterial pattern and radiosusceptibility, we used 16S rRNA sequencing to analyse the enteric bacterial profile in the mice faeces after



















































































irradiation exposure on days 5 and 10. As shown in Fig 1A and B,
6.5 Gy gamma ray altered the diversity and composition of enteric bacteria in male but not in female C57BL/6 mice. Antibiotic treat- ment has been reported to be capable of shifting the intestinal bacte- rial communities in mice (Theriot et al, 2014; Brown et al, 2016). Accordingly, mice were administered drinking water containing ampicillin or streptomycin for 6 weeks, and then, we performed 16S rRNA sequencing analysis and obtained that enteric bacterial composition of antibiotic-fed mice (Abt mice) was quite different from that of controls (drinking water without antibiotics; Fig 1C and D); however, the gut microbiota of control mice did not change overtly during the 6 weeks (Appendix Fig S1A and B). After 6.5 Gy total body irradiation (TBI), our observations revealed that the survival rate of Abt mice was significantly higher than that of controls,    indicating    that    changes    in    the    intestinal  bacterial

communities are able to influence the radiosensitivity of both male and female mice (Fig 1E and F). A decrease in peripheral  white blood cell (WBC) counts has been observed in irradiated animals (Deng et al, 2015). Although we observed that ampicillin and strep- tomycin conferred protection against sub-lethal irradiation, these antibiotics did not heighten peripheral WBC counts (Appendix Fig S1C and D), indicating that antibiotics could not ameliorate radia- tion-induced haematopoietic syndrome.

Gavage of faecal microbiota protects against radiation-induced death

Divergent factors, such as genetic predisposition, diet and inflamma- tion states, can differently affect enteric bacterial flora (Smith et al, 2015; Schaubeck et al, 2016). Therefore, we compared the diversity





of gut bacterial composition between male and female C57BL/6  mice using 16S rRNA sequencing before irradiation. Interestingly, we found that the bacteria taxonomic proportions in stool of male  and female mice were different (Fig 2A). Compared with female mice, male animals harboured a higher frequency of Bacteroides but a lower frequency of Prevotella at the genus level (Fig 2B and Appendix Fig S1E). Accordingly, we performed sex-matched or mismatched FMT according to the following scheme: female faecal microbiota transplants to male or female mice (female + TBI); male faecal microbiota transplants to male or female mice (male + TBI); and a mixture of faecal microbiota from male and female transplants to male or female mice (female/male + TBI, the weight of male and female stool was 1:1); saline was used as a control (saline + TBI). The C56BL/6 mice were separated into their respective cohorts and gavage with faecal microbiota or saline after  TBI, as depicted in    Fig 2C. Notably, the faecal microbiota treatments overtly increased the survival rate and body weight of male and female mice after
6.5 Gy TBI (Figs 2D and E, and EV1A and B). In particular, the optimal results were obtained when the gender of donors matched with that of recipients, indicating that FMT is an effective therapy against radiation-induced death in a mouse model and its efficiency is determined by the gender matched between the donor and recipient. We also repeated the experiments using older donors, but the three kinds of FMT all failed to increase the survival rate of irradiated male and female mice (data not shown).
To better understand the effect of the gut flora on the haematopoietic system, we checked the size of the  spleens  from each group. The size of the  spleens was reduced  after irradiation,  but  restored  in  the  female + TBI,   male + TBI   and   female/   male + TBI treatment groups (Figs 2F and G, and EV1C and D). Moreover, these treatment regimens also elevated WBC counts slightly in the peripheral blood (Fig EV1E and G) without affecting blood haemoglobin levels (Fig EV1F and H). Because TBI ablates all marrow and FMT only mitigates TBI-induced haematopoietic toxic- ity slightly, we further performed FMT combined with bone marrow transplant (BMT; Fig 2H). After 8 Gy irradiation exposure, the survival rate of mice treated with FMT combined with BMT was much higher than that of mice treated FMT or BMT alone (Figs 2I and EV1I), suggesting that FMT combined with BMT might significantly mitigate irradiation-induced toxicity.

FMT restores GI tract function and epithelial integrity after irradiation

On the basis of the aforementioned observations, we further untan- gled the impact of FMT on GI function and integrity in animals receiving faecal microbiota transferred from the same gender after irradiation exposure. Day 21 after 6.5 Gy TBI, haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining revealed a dramatic decrease in the number of intact intestinal villi, which was rescued by gut microbiota  treat- ment (Figs 3A and EV2A). The Alcian Blue periodic acid-Schiff (AB- PAS) and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining further showed that FMT thickened the mucus layer and increased the number of goblet cells obviously which injured by irradiation exposure (Figs 3A and EV2A) in male and female mice. In addition, the total amount of formed stool gathered from the cage of the saline-treated group was much lower than that of the FMT group (Figs 3B and C, and EV2B and C). Moreover, FMT decreased the radiation-heightened FITC-

dextran level in peripheral blood (Figs 3D and EV2D), suggesting that FMT improves GI tract function and epithelial integrity in irra- diated animals. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), we further validated the finding that the expression of Muc2, Glut1 (Slc2a1), Pgk1, intestinal trefoil factor (TFF3/ITF1) and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) (Figs 3E-I and EV2E-I), which all participate in epithelial integrity maintaining after toxic stimuli, reached about threefold higher levels in the small intestine tissues of both irradiated male and female mice after FMT. Together, our observations demonstrate that gavage of gut microbiota improves GI tract function and epithelial integrity after irradiation.

FMT alters gut bacterial composition structure after irradiation

To elucidate the mechanism of FMT mitigating radiation-induced toxicity, we performed 16S rRNA sequencing to analyse the bacterial taxonomic composition in faecal microbiota-treated and saline- treated animals. Irradiation caused persistent dysbiosis in the gut bacterial ecosystem at days 5 and 10, and FMT effectively erased these changes; in male mice, for example, irradiation continually decreased the frequency of Bacteroides (or Lactobacillus) at the genus level (Fig 4A), but male + TBI treatment increased (or stabi- lized) the frequency of Bacteroides  (or  Lactobacillus)  at  day  5  (Fig 4B). In contrast, female + TBI treatment led to a reduction in Bacteroides and a bloom in Lactobacillus at day 5, whereas female/ male + TBI  treatment  led  to  opposite  alterations  in   the   flora (Fig EV3A and B). At day 10, the frequency of Bacteroides and Lacto- bacillus dropped in all gut microbe-treated male mice (Figs 4A and  B, and EV3A and B). Moreover, in the saline and female treatment groups, the frequency of Prevotella at the genus level decreased progressively (Figs 4C and EV3C), whereas the frequency of Prevo- tella was increased in male and  female/male  treatment  cohorts  (Figs 4D and EV3D). In female mice, the frequency of Bacteroides was elevated at day 5 and then declined to a lower level at day 10 in almost all animals (Figs 4E and F, and EV3E and F). Notably,  female + TBI treatment recovered the frequency of Bacteroides to the level of controls at day 10 (Fig 4F). In addition, at day 10, the saline, male and female/male treatment groups showed a reduction in the Prevotella frequency at the genus level (Figs 4G and EV3G and H), but the female  treatment  group  exhibited  the  reverse  outcome  (Fig 4H). Thus, our observation indicates that FMT has a profound influence on the radiation-altered gut bacterial composition.
Next, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to further determine the role of FMT in changing the intestinal bacterial flora profile. As shown in Fig 5A, the gut bacterial composition profile substantially changed after radiation exposure at day 10  in  male mice and was inhibited by gut microbial therapy (Figs 5B and EV4A and B). As expected, irradiation exposure shaped the intestinal bacterial composition of female mice, and microbial therapy altered the composition of faecal microbial flora in these animals (Figs 5C and D, and EV4C and D). Specifically, irradiation exposure caused a down-regulation of the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes (or Firmicutes) at the phylum level in male mice (or in female mice) at day 10, but FMT reversed this down-regulation (Figs 5E-H and EV4E-H). Together, our observation demonstrates that gut micro- biota treatment preserves the gut bacterial composition in both male and female mice after exposure to radiation.



















































FMT retains the gene expression profile of the small intestine after irradiation

To further decipher the protective mechanism of FMT,  we  performed gene ontology (GO) analysis  using  small  intestine tissues from saline and sex-matched FMT treatment groups. Inter- estingly, compared with the saline treatment group,  the  top  30  terms exhibiting significant expression alterations were mostly involved in innate and adaptive immunity in  male  mice  treated  with sex-matched FMT (Fig 6A). However, sex-matched FMT altered the expression of genes involved in metabolism in

irradiated female mice, including genes required for cellular lipid catabolic processes and fatty acid beta-oxidation  (Fig 6B), suggesting that different sex-specific intestinal microbiota dictates their divergent physiologic status. In addition, we assessed the  mRNA expression profile of genes involved in immunity and metabolism by cluster analysis and  found  remarkable  changes  in the immune and metabolic gene expression  profiles  between  the  gut microbe-treated experimental group  and  the  saline-treated  group (Fig 6C-F), indicating that the hosts are responsive to intestinal microbiota treatment. We also compared the gene expression profile of small intestine tissues from irradiated mice

between saline treatment and sex-mismatched (or  sex-mixed)  groups. GO analysis revealed that sex-mismatched (or sex-mixed) FMT-enriched top 30 terms were quite different from those

altered by sex-matched FMT in male (Appendix Fig S2A-D) and female mice (Appendix Fig S3A-D), which further validated  that  the effect of sex-specific intestinal microbiota on hosts was

in our study and  observed  that  lncRNA  expression  was  retained  in sex-matched FMT-treated mice (Appendix Figs S4-S7), indicat- ing that the intestinal microbiota transplant affects the host's

FMT enhances angiogenesis but does not accelerate tumour growth

Angiogenesis has been regarded as a protective effector against radiation-induced toxicity. Thus, we further investigated whether intestinal  microbiota  transplantation  improved   angiogenesis   in the system. Intriguingly, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining revealed that the expression  of  F8,  a  marker  for  angiogenesis,  was elevated in gut microbe-treated mice compared with that of controls (Fig 7A). qPCR assays further validated that gut microbe transplant up-regulated the expression level of  Vegf  mRNA  in  small intestine (Fig 7B), suggesting that FMT accelerates angio- genesis  in  the  small  intestine  of  irradiated  male  and  female mice.
Angiogenesis also shows a positive relationship with tumour development. Radiotherapy is one of the most successful and widely used cancer therapies (Svensson et al,  2006).  To  investigate whether FMT can be used to improve prognosis in tumour radio- therapy, we further examined whether FMT accelerated tumour cell proliferation in vivo. Accordingly, C57BL/6 mice were injected with HT29 (or A549) tumour cells subcutaneously (Fig EV5A and B) and treated with faecal microorganisms for 10 days. We found that gut microbe treatment did not significantly change the animals' body weight (Fig EV5C-F) and the volume and weight of the tumours in animals receiving exogenous cancer cells (Fig 7C-F),  suggesting that intestinal microbiota transplant might be employed as a radioprotector to improve prognosis in cancer radiotherapy.  Together, our data demonstrate that FMT improves angiogenesis without facilitating tumour growth.


Discussion
The gastrointestinal tract is inhabited by a dense population of organized and highly specialized microbial flora that collectively modulates host immunity and metabolism. Compositional and functional changes in commensal microbiota are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases (Petrof & Khoruts, 2014; Vanhoecke et al, 2015). Recently, epidemiological and clini- cal studies on symbiotic microbiota have experienced a renaissance

(Vasconcelos et al, 2016). Understanding how the enteric micro- biota affects health and disease requires a paradigm shift from focusing on individual pathogens to an ecological approach that considers the community as a whole (Lozupone et al, 2012). These intestinal microbes boost biofilm formation by facilitating microbial co-aggregation and the production of biosurfactants and bacteri- ocins, which selectively kill other microorganisms to maintain microbiota stability, enhance gut barrier function through interact-  ing with epithelia and modulate the  host immune function (Borody  & Khoruts, 2012). It is thus possible that pharmacological modification of the intestinal microbiome can be a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of many human diseases (Owyang & Wu, 2014). For example, targeted restoration of the intestinal bacteria is beneficial in treating recalcitrant or recurring C. difficile infection (Lawley et al, 2012). Strategically, FMT is the most direct and radi- cal way to alter the composition of a human's enteric microbiota to improve the quality of life in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Moayyedi et al, 2015; Wei et al, 2015), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Le  Roy  et  al,  2013),  metabolic  syndrome  (Vrieze  et al, 2012) and neuropsychiatric disorders (Xu et al, 2015). Thus   far however, whether FMT could be used as a therapeutic method     to ameliorate radiation-induced toxicity remains unknown.  Given  the changes in the  microbiota  vary with time, we performed FMT   to treat irradiated mice for 10 days and  observed  that  FMT preserved the radiation-impaired enteric bacterial  composition  during these 10 days. We observed that multiple FMT doses increased the survival rate of irradiated mice suggesting that FMT administration may provide protection against radiation-induced toxicity. Therefore, our findings support the hypothesis that FMT might emerge as a potential therapeutic option  for  radiation- induced death.
Given that multiple factors, such as age and genetics (Lozupone et al, 2012), can drive gut microbiota alteration, the use of FMT should follow guidelines. Clinical studies noted that donors with any gastrointestinal complaints, metabolic syndrome, autoimmune diseases or allergic diseases should be excluded (Borody & Khoruts, 2012). Here, our high-throughput sequencing showed a difference in the intestinal bacterial composition between male and female C57BL/6 mice. Thus, we achieved sex-matched and mismatched FMT and discovered that the optimal therapeutic efficacy of FMT was obtained when the sex of donors matched recipients. Although sex-matched, sex-mismatched and sex-mixed FMT shaped the gut bacterial composition of irradiated mice efficiently, the frequency of

specific bacteria changed by the three kinds of FMT was different, suggesting that the colonization of key bacterial strains might contri- bute to the efficient of FMT-mitigated radiation-induced toxicity. Together, our observations bolster the position that establishing

syndrome (Waselenko et al, 2004), we examined the role  of intestinal microbes on mitigating radiation-induced bone marrow toxicity  and GI  toxicity. The reduction in  the number  and/or size  of the splenic germinal centre and memory CD4+ T cells in germ- free mice (Cerf-Bensussan & Gaboriau-Routhiau, 2010) suggested  an important role of gut microbiota in the development of the peripheral immune system. Likewise, we found that FMT was able  to restore the size of spleens in  irradiated  mice,  indicating  that  FMT might similarly strengthen the immune system of radiation- exposed mice. Owing to gut microbiota treatment elevated WBC counts in the peripheral blood slightly, we further preformed FMT combined with BMT to remedy TBI-induced toxicity. Notably, comparing with FMT or BMT alone, administration of FMT combined with BMT overtly increased the survival rate of  mice  after 8 Gy irradiation exposure, suggesting that bone marrow toxic- ity might be the main limiting factor for therapeutic effect of FMT. On the basis of our investigations, we concluded  that  FMT improved GI tract function and intestinal epithelial integrity after irradiation, suggesting that FMT could be a potential therapy for radiation-induced GI toxicity. In agreement with the role of

angiogenesis in radioprotection (Okunieff et al, 1998),  we  found that FMT was capable of up-regulating Vegf level in the small intestine of irradiated mice. Because VEGF also facilitates the development of tumorigenesis (Carmeliet & Jain, 2011), we deter- mined whether enteric microbiota transplant could accelerate the growth of cancer cells following subcutaneous  implantation  of  either lung or colon cancer cells into C57BL/6 mice. Our data  showed that FMT failed to enhance the proliferation of the carci- noma cells. Therefore, as a potential therapeutic approach to miti- gate radiation-induced toxicity, FMT might be used in tumour radiotherapy to improve the prognosis.
At the molecular level, microarray analysis revealed a marked difference in the mRNA expression profile  in  small  intestine  tissues between FMT-treated and saline-treated mice. Our observa- tion showed that the gavage of sex-matched faecal microbiota had distinguishable  effects  on  immunity  and  metabolism  (Marcobal  et al, 2013; Bromberg et al, 2015), suggesting that different sex- specific gut microbiota performs  divergent  physiologic  status. Given that lncRNAs, which have been primarily studied in the context of genomic imprinting, cancer, and cell differentiation, are





now emerging as important regulators of immunity and  metabo-  lism (Cui et al, 2015a,b; Yao et al, 2016), we analysed the related lncRNA expression pattern in parallel.  As  expected,  FMT caused an alteration in the spectrum  of  lncRNA  expression,  indicating  that gut microbe transplant not only preserves intestinal bacterial composition in hosts but also retains the mRNA and lncRNA expression profile. LncRNAs are  able  to  interact  with  chromatin  at several thousand different locations across multiple chromo-  somes and govern large-scale gene expression programmes  (Guttman & Rinn, 2012; Vance & Ponting, 2014), and they have been regarded as pivotal modulators of physiologic or pathologic status (Ponting et al, 2009). They also regulate gene expression profiles at the post-transcriptional level through influencing the stability of mRNA (Gong & Maquat, 2011; Kretz et al, 2013). Our findings now suggest that the gut microbe transplant-mediated lncRNA expression profile fluctuations might play  important roles  in mitigating radiation-induced injury, which  warrants  further  study.
In conclusion, our work demonstrates that gavage  of  gut microbes alleviates and protects against radiation-induced  injury  in a mouse model. Specifically, FMT is able to heighten the survival rate of irradiated mice. Moreover, FMT improves GI tract function and epithelial integrity to ameliorate irradiation-induced GI toxicity. Mechanistically, intestinal microbiota transplant preserves the bacterial communities and retains mRNA as well as the lncRNA expression profile in the hosts. Thus, our findings provide new insights into the function of FMT. Clinically, our observations underpin the suggestion that FMT might be employed as a novel therapeutic method for irradiation-induced injury to improve the prognosis of patients after radiotherapy.


Materials and Methods
Animal studies

Six- to eight-week-old male and female C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Vital River (Beijing, China), mice were housed in the specific pathogen-free level animal facility at the Institute of Radiation Medicine (IRM), the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS). Mice were kept under standard conditions (ambi- ent temperature 22 +- 2degC, air humidity 40-70% and a 12/12-h light/dark cycle) and continuous access to a standard diet and water. All male and female mice in this study were of a pure C57BL/6 genetic background and separated into groups randomly, treated according to the guidelines established by the National Insti- tutes of Health Guide (NIH) for use. All experiments were done in accordance with procedures approved by the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Medical Innovation Foundation (DGMIF) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). All procedures and animal handlings were performed following the ethical guidelines for animal studies.

Irradiation studies

A Gammacell(r) 40 Exactor (Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, Chalk River, ON, Canada) at a dose rate of 1.0 Gy per minute was used for all experiments. Non-anaesthestized mice were immobilized in a specific steel chamber, and radiation dose was monitored by a dose

rate meter (Cui et al, 2016). Male (approximately 20 g in body weight) and female (approximately 18 g) mice were treated with a single dose of 6.5 Gy gamma ray at a rate of 1.0 Gy/min (total body irradiation, TBI). After irradiation, the mice were returned to the animal facility for daily observation and treatment as described below. The body weight of radiation-exposed mice was assessed dieb. tert.

Antibiotics test

Weaning male and female mice (about 4-week-old) were treated for 4-6 weeks with ampicillin (1,000 lg/ml) or streptomycin (500 lg/ml) in their drinking water, respectively. The fresh antibiotic  solution was prepared every day to promise its activity. Antibiotics were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France). Male (approximately 22 g) and female (approximately 20 g) mice were treated with single dose of 6.5 Gy at a rate of 1.0 Gy/min.

Donor stool preparation and administration

The healthy 6- to 8-week-old male and female C57BL/6 mice were kept in same housing and environmental conditions. Conventional, untreated, age-matched male and female mice were used as donors   to collect gut microbiota. The donor's faecal pellets were collected under SPF conditions. Donor stool was  freshly  prepared  on  the  day of transplant and that in all cases was prepared and  trans-  planted  within  4  h.  Donor  stool  was  weighed  and  diluted  with  1 ml of saline per 0.1 g of stool. Briefly, the stool was steeped in saline for about 15 min, shaken  and  then  centrifuged  at  800 rpm for 3 min. The supernatant was  obtained  for  treatment.  The  mice in each group were treated with same  sample.  Same  weight  of  male and female stool was mix to  perform  male/female  gut  microbe mixture.

Peripheral blood cell counts

One hundred microlitres of peripheral blood was obtained from the orbital sinus using a micro-pipette coated with the anticoagulant, K2EDTA, 15 days after 6.5 Gy irradiation. The cell counts included white blood cells (WBCs) and haemoglobin (HGB) was counted using a Celltac E hemocytometer (Nihon Kohden, Japan).

Measure of spleens

Male (approximately 20 g) and female (approximately 18 g) C56BL/6 mice were treated with single dose of 6.5 Gy gamma ray. After  15 days, the mice were euthanized, and the spleens were excised and measured.

Formed faecal collection

For this study, six mice (6- to 8-week-old male or female C57BL/6J mice) were fed in one cage. They were kept under the same environment with other experimental mice. Formed faecal were collected from cage bedding on the day before irradiation, day 1 after irradiation, day 5 after irradiation and day 10 after irradiation. Then, we counted the number of formed stools in both saline group and FMT group.





Histology

At day 21 after 6.5 Gy TBI, mice were anaesthetized and the entire small intestine was harvested and used to collect tissue for histology. Briefly, small intestine tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde  solution  overnight,  and  4-lm  paraffin  sections were processed to performed H&E and IHC staining. For H&E stain- ing, the sections were dipped in haematoxylin for 10 min and eosin for 3 min (Perez-Garcia et al, 2015). For IHC staining, primary antibody of anti-F8 (M0616, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) was used (Koo et al, 2009). Small intestine tissues were fixed in methanol- Carnoy (60% dry methanol, 30% chloroform, 10% glacial acetic acid) solution overnight, and 4-lm paraffin sections were processed to performed AB-PAS and PAS staining. For AB-PAS staining, dewaxed sections were hydrated and incubated in AB for 20 min. Sections were subsequently washed with water before incubation in 1% periodic acid for 10 min followed by incubation in Schiff's reagent for 10 min. Sections were counterstained with Mayer's haematoxylin for 30 s, washed and dehydrated before mounting with Pertex. For PAS staining, dewaxed sections were hydrated and incubated in 1% periodic acid for 10 min followed by incubation in Schiff's reagent for 10 min. Sections were counterstained with Mayer's haematoxylin for 30 s, washed and dehydrated before mounting with Pertex.

FITC-dextran permeability experiments

The mice were administrated with (or without) sex-matched FMT following 6.5 Gy total body irradiation. After 21 days, mice were fasted 14 h and gavaged with 60 mg per 100 g body weight of fluo- rescein  isothiocyanate-dextran  (FITC-dextran,  FD4,  3,000-  5,000 kD, Sigma-Aldrich, Madrid, Spain) in a volume of 0.2 ml. Blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture at 4 h after administration of FITC-dextran and centrifuged at 860 g for 5 min   at room temperature to obtain the serum. Fluorescence intensity of each serum sample (DTX 880 Multimode Detector, Beckman Coul- ter, CA, USA) was measured.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction

Total RNA was extracted from the tissues using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription was performed using poly (A)-tailed total RNA and reverse transcription primer with ImPro-IIReverse Transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed according to the instructions of Fast Start Universal SYBR Green Master (Rox) (Roche Diagnostics GmbH Mannheim, Germany). All primers are listed in Appendix Table S1. GAPDH was used as the controls.

In vivo tumorigenicity assay

C57BL/6 mice were housed and treated according to the guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. We conducted animal transplanta- tions according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Briefly, HT29 (or A549) cells were harvested and re-suspended at 2 x 107 cells per ml

in sterile phosphate-buffered saline. Groups  of  4-week-old  male  and female C57BL/6 mice (Experiment Animal Center of Peking, China)  (each  group,  n  = 5)  were  subcutaneously   injected   at   the shoulder with 0.2 ml of the cell suspensions and treated with faeces microorganism (or saline) for 10 days. After 20 days, tumour-bearing mice were euthanized, and the  tumours  were excised and measured.

Bacterial diversity analysis

For this study, four mice were fed in one cage. Stool samples were freshly collected and stored at 80degC until use. DNA was extracted from the stool using the Power Fecal(r) DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio Carlsbad, CA USA). The DNA was recovered with 30 ml of buffer in the kit. The 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) V4 gene was analysed to evaluate the bacterial diversity using Illumina Hiseq (Novogene Bioinformatics Technology Co., Ltd.). Sequences analysis was performed by Uparse software (Uparse v7.0.1001,  /). Sequences with >= 97% similarity were assigned to the same OTUs. Representative sequence for each OTU was screened for further annotation. For each representative sequence, the Silva123 Database was used based on RDP classifier (Version 2.2, /) algorithm to annotate taxonomic information. The primers are listed in Appendix Table S1.

Microarray analysis

Briefly, three male and female C57BL/6 mice treated with saline were grouped as controls.  The  gut  microbes  of  three  males  used to treat male mice and the gut microbes of three  females used  to treat female mice were  regarded  as  individual  experimental  groups. The mice were euthanized at day 21 after irradiation, and    the small intestine tissues were  excised.  These  three  paired  samples were used to synthesize double-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA), and the cDNA was labelled and hybridized to  lncRNA + mRNA Capitalbiotech Sureprint Mouse lncRNA Gene Expression 4*180K (CapitalBio  Corp,  Beijing,  China)  according  to  the   manufacturer's   instructions.   The   data   from   the   lncRNA + mRNA microarray were used to analyse the data summarization, normalization and quality control  using  Gene  Spring software V11.5 (Agilent). The differentially expressed genes were selected if the change of the threshold values was > 2.0-fold  and if the Benjamini-Hochberg-corrected P-values  were  < 0.05. The data were normalized and hierarchically clustered with  CLUSTER 3.0 software. The data were visualized with Java Tree view software. GEO accession number: GSE92249.

Statistical analysis

Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Significance was assessed by comparing the mean values (standard deviation; SD) using Student's t-test and Wilcoxon rank sum test for independent groups as follows: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. Kaplan- Meier analysis was performed for survival analysis, and significance between survival curves was determined by a log-rank test.
