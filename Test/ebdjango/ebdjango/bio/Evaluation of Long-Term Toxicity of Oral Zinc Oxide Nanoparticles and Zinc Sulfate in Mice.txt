Abstract The toxicological effects of zinc oxide nanopar- ticles (nano-ZnOs) are related to their dissolution and inter- ference with zinc ion homeostasis. High-soluble zinc sources may produce more severe and acute toxicity; how- ever, the evaluation of potential toxicity of long-term expo- sure to nano-ZnOs and high-soluble sources of zinc remains obscure. This study aimed at evaluating effects of nano- ZnOs and zinc sulfate on development, serum and hemato- logical parameters, and mineral concentrations in selected tissues and intestinal microbiota in mice via gastrointestinal administration for 7 weeks. Results indicated that
250 mg/kg nano-ZnOs reduced the body weight from weeks 8 to 11, increased serum glutamic-pyruvic trans- aminase activity, and increased  the  zinc  concentrations  of the serum, liver, and kidney while did not affect the relative organ weight, intestinal microbiota, and other mineral concen- trations (Fe, Cu, and Mn) in the kidney, liver, and thigh muscle. Oral administration with 250 mg/kg zinc sulfate seemed to show more severe and acute toxicity since mice in zinc sulfate group exhibited reduced body weight from weeks 5 to 11, decreased relative pancreas weight, and increased serum glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase activity and intestinal enteric group.

Introduction

With the rapid development of nanotechnology, more con- cerns have been spurred over the potential detrimental effects of manufactured nanomaterials on human health and environ- ment [-]. The potential toxicity of zinc oxide nanoparticles (nano-ZnOs) is receiving increasing attention since nano- ZnOs are widely used, such as in cosmetics, sunscreens, plas- tics, and rubber []. Owing to the high antibacterial activity and stability, nano-ZnOs are becoming the extremely attrac- tive materials in fields of food additives, packing and agricul- ture, and biomedicine [, ], which leads to even more con- cerns about human health and environment.
Although several studies had been conducted on the tox- icity of nano-ZnOs, most of these studies focused on the acute toxicity, respiratory toxicity, or  cytotoxicity. Wang et al. [] found the acute oral toxicity of high doses of nano-ZnOs (1-5 g/kg body weight; size of 20 and 120 nm) via the damaged liver, spleen, and pancreas in mice. Yan et al. [] reported that oral treatment with nano- ZnOs for 14 days can disturb energy metabolism and cause mitochondria and cell membrane impairment in rat kidney via inducing nephrotoxicity. It was also identified that nano-ZnOs could produce prenatal development toxicity after the 15-day oral treatment [, ]. Wang et al. [] found that inhalation exposure to nano-ZnOs for 3  days  led to severe damage in the liver and lung, which was sim- ilar to the results reported by Beckett et al. []. Yang et al.
[] found that nano-ZnOs could elevate the lactate dehy-

ry mouse embryo fibroblasts. Lin et al. [] confirmed that nano-ZnOs resulted in intracellular oxidative stress, cell membrane leakage, and DNA damage in human lung epi- thelial cells, while long-term effects of oral exposure to nano-ZnOs on mice were rarely reported.

Evaluation of Long-Term Toxicity in Mice	277


The possible underlying mechanism of nano-ZnO toxicity has been proposed that nanoparticles could cross the cell membrane, enter the cytoplasm, and induce oxidative stress for cell damage [, ], while recently, studies indicated that zinc ion played important roles in the toxicity of nano-ZnOs. George et al. [] reported that decreasing the nano-ZnO dis- solution rate could slow zinc ion release and reduce the tox- icity. Kao et al. [] confirmed that nano-ZnOs interfered with zinc ion homeostasis to cause cytotoxicity. It could be hypoth- esized that high-soluble sources of zinc, such as zinc sulfate, may produce more severe and acute toxicity than nano-ZnOs. However, the evaluation of potential toxicity of long-term exposure to nano-ZnOs and high-soluble sources of zinc re- mains obscure. Therefore, this study was conducted via gas- trointestinal administration for 7 weeks to investigate the long-term effects of nano-ZnOs and zinc sulfate on develop- ment, serum and hematological parameters, and mineral con- centrations in selected tissues and intestinal microbiota in mice.


Materials and Methods

Experiments were approved and conducted under the super- vision of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Nanjing Agriculture University, China.

Preparation of Nano-ZnO Suspension

The nano-ZnOs were provided by Hangzhou King Techina Technology Co., Ltd (Zhejiang, China). The nano-ZnO exhib- ited nearly spherical geometry with an average diameter about 40 nm as determined with a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Hitachi H-7500, Japan), as shown in Fig. . These results were similar to those of our previous report as exam- ined by using Malvern Autosier and TEM []. The nanopar- ticles were dispersed in the deionized water by ultrasonic


vibration for 30 min, and the suspension of the nano-ZnO was stirred on the vortex agitator before use.

Animal and Experimental Design

A total of 24 CD-ICR male mice (3-week old) were randomly divided into three groups, eight mice per group. Mice in each group were housed in four polypropylene cages (each cage two mice). The mice and their pellet diet were provided by the Experimental Animal Center, Yangzhou University (Jiangsu, China). The house was kept at 21 +- 3 degC and in a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle. After the adaptation periods for 7 days, mice in the three groups were gastrointestinally ad- ministered once a day: (1) control group: 0.2 ml deionized water; (2) nano-ZnO group: 0.2 ml nano-ZnO suspension at a dose of 250 mg/kg body weight; and (3) zinc sulfate group:
0.2 ml zinc sulfate solution at a dose of 250 mg/kg body weight. During this 7-week experiment, the food and water supply, behavior patterns, and clinical signs of toxicity (leth- argy, coma, tremors, nausea, vomiting, etc.) will be checked at 8:00 and 18:00 each day. Once clinical sign occurred, mice would have been raised separately. When mice became un- conscious, they would have been sacrificed humanely with carbon dioxide. The body weight was recorded every week and no mice died.

Sample Collection

At the end of this feeding trial, mice were fasted for 6 h prior to sacrifice. The blood was taken by removalling eyeball. Tubes with EDTA-Na were used to collect the whole blood for he- matological parameters, while the serum was obtained by cen- trifugation at 3000xg for 15 min at 4 degC and stored at -80 degC until for serum parameter analysis. The organic tissues of the liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas, brain, and testis were weighed to calculate relative organ weight. The liver, kidney, and thigh

muscle (rectus femoris muscle and vastus medialis muscle) were stored at -20 degC.

Analysis of Serum and Hematological Parameters

The Zn concentration and activities of glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT), and LDH in serum were determined by corresponding com- mercial kits as the recommended procedure. Kits were provid- ed by Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (Nanjing, China). The whole-blood samples were stored at 4 degC and were analyzed within 48 h. The hematological parameters were analyzed by an automatic hematology analyzer, includ- ing white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells (RBC), neutro- phil count, lymphocyte count, monocytes, hemoglobin (HGB), and platelets (PLT).


Determination of Mineral Concentration in Selected Tissues

The mineral concentrations (Zn, Fe, Cu, and Mn) of the liver, kidney, and thigh muscle were determined as described by Demirbas []. Briefly, tissues were digested using an acid mixture (HNO3:HClO4 = 4:1, v:v). The digest was brought to a volume of 25 ml with demineralized water. Blanks and standard solutions were prepared. After that, external matrix- matched standard curves (standards added to 4% HNO3 solu- tion as for samples) were used to analyze the mineral concen- trations via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, USA).


Microbiological Analysis

The bacteria were quantified with the method of fluorescent in situ hybridization and flow cytometry as described by Xie et al. [] and Vaahtovuo et al. []. Briefly, the cecal digesta were suspended in phosphate buffer solution (1:10 w/v). After incubated at 4 degC, the suspension was centri- fuged at 120xg for 60 s to remove debris. After the super- natant was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution, bacteria were obtained by centrifugation at 12,000xg for 5 min. The bacteria were stored in 50% ethanol/phosphate buffer solu- tion at -20 degC until for analysis. The 16S rRNA-based ol- igonucleotide probes included Enter 1432 [] and Bif 164 [], which targeted to enteric group and bifidobacterium, respectively. The bacteria were hybridized with the probes in the hybridization buffer at 50 degC for 16 h. The hybridi- zation solution was diluted with phosphate buffer solution and analyzed using the BD FACSCalibur(tm) flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, USA).

Statistical Analysis

All the data were expressed as mean +- SE, which were ana- lyzed by Tukey's multiple range test of SPSS statistical pack- age for Windows (version 20.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The cage was used as the experimental unit for the data of body weight, and individual mouse was the unit for the other pa- rameters. Treatment difference of P < 0.05 was considered significant, and 0.05 < P < 0.10 was considered a tendency.


Results

Body Weights

At the duration of this animal trial, the body weights were recorded weekly and are presented in Fig. . As shown in Fig. , the body weight of the mice in the zinc sulfate group was significantly lower than that of the control mice from weeks 5 to 11 (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference between the control and nano-ZnO groups from weeks 5 to 7 (P > 0.05), and the body weight was significantly decreased by oral administration with nano-ZnOs as com- pared to that of  the control mice from weeks 8  to  11  (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between nano-ZnO and zinc sulfate groups (P > 0.05).

The Relative Organ Weight

Effects of nano-ZnOs and zinc sulfate on the relative organ weight are shown in Table . Results indicated that oral nano- ZnOs and zinc sulfate did not affect the relative organ weights of the liver, spleen, brain, and testis (P > 0.05). However, the

Discussion

Zinc is an essential trace element for human and animals, and zinc oxide (ZnO) is widely used as a nutritional or medical additive [, ]. It is well known that dietary added pharmaco- logic concentrations of ZnO (2000-4000 mg/kg) alleviate post- weaning diarrhea, enhance the immunity, and improve growth performance in weaning piglets [-]. Owing to the multiple properties and easy synthesis [], nano-ZnOs exhibit great potentials in many fields, including food additives, biomedi- cine, and feed additives [, , ]. Recently, it had been docu- mented that the toxicological effects of nano-ZnOs were related to their dissolution and interference with zinc ion homeostasis. High-soluble zinc sources may produce more severe and acute toxicity; however, the evaluation of potential toxicity of long- term exposure to nano-ZnOs and high-soluble sources of zinc, such as zinc sulfate, remains obscure.
Previous studies verified that body and organ weights are important and sensitive indicators for toxicity studies on ani- mals [-]. In our present study, the growing mice were used to investigate the long-term effects of nano-ZnOs and zinc sulfate via gastrointestinal administration for 7 weeks. Results indicated nano-ZnOs decreased the body weight after the treatment for 3 weeks while mice in the zinc sulfate group exhibited lower body weight after the treatment for only    1 week. At the same time, nano-ZnOs did not affect the rela- tive organ weights, including the liver, spleen, brain, testis, and pancreas, while zinc sulfate decreased the relative weight of the pancreas. These results suggested that oral 250 mg/kg zinc sulfate might show much more acute and severe toxicity in mice than nano-ZnOs. Similar to our results, Jo et al. [] showed that the body weight gain of the treated rats by gavage 500 mg/kg nano-ZnOs was about up to 16% lower than that of the control rats, and no obvious detrimental effects on the testes, epididymides, and ovaries were found. Ko et al. [] reported that gavage 500 mg/kg nano-ZnOs for 2 weeks did

not affect the rat body weight while rats in 1000- and 2000- mg/kg groups had lower body weight gain and decreased feed consumption. Prenatal rat oral exposure to 15-day repeated 400 mg/kg nano-ZnOs showed reduced food consumption, increased adrenal gland weight, and decreased body and liver weight []. The different toxicity of nano-ZnOs in these stud- ies could be due to differences in the experimental duration, animal types, and quality of nano-ZnOs.
Activities of GOT, GPT, and LDH in serum were deter- mined to evaluate the liver injury. Results indicated gastroin- testinal administration with 250 mg/kg nano-ZnOs and zinc sulfate for 7 weeks increased serum GPT activity and tended to increase the serum LDH activity in mice. In agreement with our present results, Wang et al. [] verified that oral 5 g zinc/kg body weight as nano-ZnOs for 14 days significantly increased serum activities of GOT, GPT, and LDH. Piao et al. [] report- ed that intraperitoneal administration of 8 mg/kg zinc acetate damaged the liver and decreased serum GOT activity in rats. Sharma et al. [] also found that oral exposure to 300 mg/kg nano-ZnOs elevated alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase serum levels and pathological lesions in the liver. The authors proposed that the liver damage could be attributed

to the accumulation of nanoparticles, which further induced oxidative stress, DNA damage, and apoptosis []. However, oral administration with 250 mg/kg zinc sulfate also led to liver damage in our present study, which indicated that the damage might be due to the accumulation of zinc. The forms of accu- mulated liver zinc (nano-ZnO or other zinc forms) have not been determined in the present study, which should be further investigated in the future.
Wang et al. [] reported that oral 5 g/kg body weight nano- ZnOs significantly decreased the blood HGB and hematocrit and increased the red cell distribution width corpuscular vol- ume and PLT in mice, suggesting heavy anemia might occur. Some other researchers documented that excessive dietary zinc could induce deficiencies of copper and iron and then cause anemia [-]. However, our results indicated that nano- ZnOs and zinc sulfate did not affect blood PLT. Moreover, nano-ZnOs significantly increased the blood HGB and neutro- phil count, which suggested long-term treatment with nano- ZnOs might alter the immune function in mice [].
The zinc level in serum and mineral concentrations (Zn, Fe, Cu, and Mn) in selected tissues had been determined in the present study. Results indicated that oral administration with

250 mg/kg nano-ZnOs and zinc sulfate for 7 weeks increased the zinc concentrations in the serum, liver, and kidney, which means that oral nano-ZnOs and zinc sulfate enhanced zinc ab- sorption, which is in line with our previous study []. Wang et al. [] also reported that oral exposure to 20- or 120-nm ZnO increased the kidney zinc level in mice. However, the zinc concentration in the thigh muscle was not affected by nano- ZnOs or zinc sulfate in our present study, which was in line with previous reports. They verified that the variation of muscle zinc was not large and the zinc concentration of muscle might not be a sensitive indicator for zinc status [, , ]. In addi- tion, our results indicated that other mineral concentrations (Fe, Cu, and Mn) in the liver, kidney, and thigh muscle were not affected by oral nano-ZnOs or zinc sulfate, which partially ex- plained our results that no anemia occurred in this study.
Intestinal microbiota is very important to human and animals via affecting metabolism and intestinal immunity [, ]. In this study, intestinal bacterial population was determined with flow cytometry analysis which is a rapid and reliable solution compared with methods based on cultivation or amplification of the nucleic acids [, , ]. Bacteria belonging to the enteric group are commonly considered as potential or condi- tioned gastrointestinal pathogens, while bifidobacterium was beneficial to the host []. Our results indicated that oral zinc sulfate increased the proportion of the enteric group, while nano-ZnOs did not affect the intestinal bacterial population (bifidobacterium and enteric groups), which suggested that oral 250 mg/kg zinc sulfate altered the intestinal microbiota and might be harmful to the intestinal immune system.


Conclusions

In summary, although intestinal microbiota and tissue concen- trations of Fe, Cu, and Mn were not affected, gastrointestinal administration of 250 mg/kg nano-ZnOs for 7 weeks exhibit- ed toxic effects on mice, including decreased body weight, liver damage (elevated serum GPT activity), and increased zinc accumulation in the liver and kidney. According to the literature and our findings, exposure to nano-ZnOs may lead to liver damage, which might be due to the accumulation of zinc. More researches are needed to investigate the forms of accumulated liver zinc (nano-ZnO or other zinc forms) after


oral administration with nano-ZnOs. Compared to nano- ZnOs, oral 250 mg/kg zinc sulfate seemed to show similar or much more severe and acute toxicity in mice via acute decrease in body weight, increased serum GOT activity, and altered intestinal microbiota. In the future, it is better to inves- tigate the long-term effects of nano-ZnOs and zinc sulfate with more suitable animal models, such as the model of pigs.
