Food for thought: why does the medical community struggle with research about nutritional therapy in the acute care setting?
Philipp Schuetz























Background
Nutritional research experienced a very promising start in 1747 with James Lind conducting the first ever randomized controlled trial comparing six different treatments for 12 sailors with scurvy [ Hippocrates, himself, had great  hopes  for  nutritional  interventions  to cure disease ("Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food"). Today, however, there are few rigorously conducted trials of nutritional interventions that assess their impact on mortality, morbidity, or other patient- centered outcomes. This is particularly true for the

acute, non-critical medical care inpatient setting, where there is an important lack of studies to guide clinicians    in the optimal use of nutrition in an "evidence-based" manner and help us understand the  potential of nutrition to cure disease, or at least to  improve  patient  out- comes [

Nutritional therapy
Regarding the question of nutrition for primary preven- tion of disease, several large randomized trials have demonstrated impact on mortality and morbidity. For example, the PREDIMED trial showed the positive ef- fects of a Mediterranean diet on cardiovascular and metabolic disease [ Additionally, several recent large trials have had an important impact on today's manage- ment of patients in the critical care setting -.

Within this population, if insufficient nutritional sup- port is provided, patients will accumulate a large energy deficit that may contribute to lean-tissue wasting, which is associated with adverse outcomes. Yet, sur- prisingly, recent evidence has pointed to detrimental effects of feeding strategies in the setting of critical ill- ness, with possible negative effects on cell recycling (autophagy) and an increase in morbidity and mortality  Further, worse outcomes due to refeeding associ- ated with early feeding have also been reported  These trials challenge our understanding of "physio- logical nutrition" in the context of severe illness. Thus, recent recommendations based on these trials suggest a hypocaloric macronutrient intake during the first week of critical illness and a continuous increase once the patient's condition has stabilized [].
Evidence from critical care studies showing harmful effects when clinical nutrition is used [   highlights the unanswered questions regarding whether acutely ill, malnourished inpatients benefit at all from nutritional support or,  conversely, whether loss of appetite should  be viewed as a protective physiological  response.  In fact, feeding in acute severe illness may be simply mal- adaptive. While observational research has reported strong associations of malnutrition and adverse out- comes, and suggested benefit from nutritional interven- tion in the medical inpatient setting, only randomized trials can prove that such interventions truly work. A recent meta-analysis focusing on  randomized trials in the medical inpatient setting that compared patients receiving nutritional interventions with patients not re- ceiving such an intervention found that nutritional  therapy increases caloric and protein intake, as well as weight  Regarding clinical outcomes, unplanned hospital readmission rates were  significantly  improved by the intervention, as well as lengths of stay in the subgroup of patients with established malnutrition. However, no effects were found on functional out- comes, infection risk, or mortality - arguably the most important outcomes. Importantly, this meta-analysis also pointed out the low quality of most of the 22 included trials (with a total of 3736 participants), with high heterogeneity across trials and an overall  unclear risk of bias. Thus, the lack of significant results regard- ing mortality and morbidity may be due to methodo- logical issues and  low  statistical power,  and  not due to  a lack of effectiveness. Indeed, since the publication of this meta-analysis, the large-scale, multicenter, placebo- controlled, interventional NOURISH trial including older malnourished adults hospitalized for congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, pneumonia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was published, that found a significant lower mortality in patients when a high-protein oral nutritional supplement containing beta-


hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate was added to standard-of- nutritional-care [.
Remarkably, therefore, basic questions such as, "What is the optimal amount of calories and protein for med- ical inpatients?"; "Which medical inpatients have  the most benefit from nutritional interventions?"; and "What type of nutrition (if any) is beneficial for the medical inpatient?" remain largely unanswered [ Further, from an evolutionary perspective, it remains unclear whether nutritional interventions should  indeed be used in patients with a  functional  gastrointestinal tract and low appetite. The loss of appetite  associated with severe disease may in fact be a protective, physio- logical response and not  a  therapeutic  target  that  can  be positively influenced by nutritional interventions Instead of continuing to use nutritional therapy  in the acute care setting based on a "gut-feeling" and on results from mainly observational and smaller random- ized, hypothesis-generating studies, we should now take   a step back and conduct high quality, randomized con- trolled trials that will aid the understanding of what, if anything, constitutes evidence-based nutritional ther- apy in specific hospitalized populations [While there is ongoing discussion about the best definitions of malnutrition ], we should rather focus on the identi- fication of patients who do or do not benefit from nutritional interventions. Specific biomarkers may be helpful to select populations in which nutritional inter- ventions will have the best effects and those  which would experience negative outcomes [
In the acute  care medical  setting  - outside critical care
- malnutrition remains an increasing problem, affecting as much as 30-50% of patients [Undoubtedly, there is a strong association between malnutrition and adverse clinical outcomes, including higher mortality and mor- bidity and increased lengths of hospital stay  These associations tempt us to believe that improvement in nutritional status by the use of nutritional interventions also leads to improvements in patient outcomes. How- ever, similar findings have been reported for nutritional factors, such as vitamin D, where associations suggested harmful effects, but intervention research failed to find benefit [, ]. Still, from a pragmatic standpoint, des- pite having few rigorously designed nutritional interven- tion trials in acute care patients, there remain several reasons to support the current approach of  systematic- ally screening inpatients for malnutrition and commen- cing nutritional therapy in those identified. First, an inadequate dietary intake leads to dysfunction of the immune system and mucosal damage in the gut, which increases the risk for diarrhea, malabsorption, bacterial invasion (translocation), and infections  Second, malnutrition is associated with adverse metabolic conse- quences, such as catabolism and muscle wasting, and






epidemiological studies from various countries and healthcare settings have shown strong associations of malnutrition and adverse patient outcomes. Third, a retrospective analysis of controlled trials found positive effects of nutritional support if patients had either impaired nutritional status or an increase in nutritional requirements resulting from high severity disease,  or both  Fourth, the above mentioned  meta-analysis  as well as the very recent NOURISH trial found some positive effects of nutritional support on readmission and mortality in medical inpatients.


Conclusions
Despite strong associations between malnutrition and adverse outcomes, causal inferences remain largely un- proven. Additionally, whether provision of nutritional therapy in the acute phase of a medical illness has the potential to reverse the adverse effects associated with malnutrition in the non-critical care inpatient setting re- mains unclear. Given the magnitude of morbidity caused by malnutrition and the high number of patients affected by this condition, it is surprising how little the medical community has invested in recent years to better under- stand ways to improve this condition in an "evidence- based" manner. Although  the use of nutritional therapy   is a common intervention in medical inpatients, there is no strong current scientific evidence of its efficacy or standard algorithms for its use in  medical  inpatients. This may be explained by difficulties in standardization, blinding, and patient compliance in  nutritional  trials, and insufficient industry-funding due to low product margins, among other issues  Still, considering recent high-quality evidence from critical care demon- strating the negative effects of nutritional therapy, a reappraisal of how nutritional support should be imple- mented in the medical inpatient setting is now re- quired. The selection, timing, dose and feasibility of nutritional treatment should  be  evaluated  as  carefully as with any other therapeutic  interventions,  with  the aim of maximizing efficacy and minimizing side effects and costs. Further, trials  should  investigate  the  effects of nutritional interventions on the microbiome, which  may play a key role in this issue. Instead of pragmatic- ally using nutritional interventions based on few rigor- ous randomized trials, we should return to James Lind's research of 1747 and perform the large and well con- ducted trials needed  to  truly  understand  the  potential of nutritional therapy to positively influence recovery from disease in the medical inpatient population.
