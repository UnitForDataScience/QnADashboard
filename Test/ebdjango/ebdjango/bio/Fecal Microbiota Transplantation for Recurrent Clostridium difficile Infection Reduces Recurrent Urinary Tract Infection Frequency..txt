Broad-spectrum antibiotics for recurrent multidrug-resistant urinary tract infections (UTIs) disrupt the gut microbiome and promote antibiotic resistance. Fecal microbiota transplantation led to resolution of recurrent Clostridium difficile, significantly decreased recurrent UTI frequency, and improved antibiotic susceptibility profile of UTI-causing organisms.

Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs)  are  among  the  most common bacterial infections, especially in the elderly. UTIs pose frequent management challenges, including anti- biotic choice, due to worsening resistance patterns with each infection. It is estimated that UTIs account for nearly 7 mil- lion office visits, 1 million emergency room visits, and about 100 000 hospitalizations per year and cost $1.6 billion annu- ally [1].
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most common nosocomial infection and has been associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with an estimated 29 000 deaths annu- ally within 30 days of infection and a high risk of recurrence [2, 3]. The most common risk factor for recurrent CDI is ongo- ing broad-spectrum systemic antibiotic exposure used to treat infections such as recurrent UTIs. These antibiotics disrupt the gut microbiota and not only lead to recurrent CDI but also facil- itate emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) in the gut. These organisms are likely the major pathogens respon- sible for recurrent UTIs, especially in patients who have profuse diarrhea due to CDI [4].
Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has emerged as an effective therapy for recurrent CDI by restoring the normal gut

microbiota [5]. Interestingly, there may be additional benefits from FMT in addition to resolution of CDI. A recent study demonstrated that FMT for recurrent CDI eradicated vancomy- cin-resistant enterococci (VRE) colonization in 73% of VRE- positive patients [6].
We hypothesized that FMT would reduce the frequency of recurrent UTIs from antibiotic-resistant organisms by decol- onization of MDROs from the gut. The institutional review board approved this study, and receipt of informed patient con- sent was verified.

METHODS
Patient Selection
We retrospectively identified patients with 3 or more UTIs in the year preceding FMT (for recurrent CDI) from May 2012  to September 2016. UTI was defined as the presence of uri- nary symptoms and urinary bacterial cultures with >105 colo- ny-forming units/mL. Eligibility criteria for FMT included third or greater CDI episode proven by a positive C. difficile polymer- ase chain reaction stool assay in the presence of diarrhea. Donor stools were obtained after obtaining an extensive medical his- tory and laboratory evaluation (blood and stool tests). Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria for donors in our program have
been previously published [7]. A control group of patients with 3 CDI episodes managed with antibiotics and 3 or more UTIs the year prior to the third CDI episode was also included.

Data Collection
We recorded patient demographics, CDI history, and frequency of UTIs in 1 year before and 1 year after FMT. Additionally, we collected microbiological data (causative microorganisms and their antibiotic-resistance patterns) from the positive urine samples.

Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using JMP, version 13.0 (SAS Institute Inc.). Demographic and clinical variables were summarized using descriptive statistics. Continuous variables are reported as median (range), and categorical variables are reported as proportions. The differences in frequency of UTIs before and after FMT or the third CDI episode for the control

 		group were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank test.

RESULTS
Recurrent Clostridium difficile Infection and Recurrent Urinary Tract Infection Patients Managed With Fecal Microbiota Transplantation
Of all patients who underwent FMT for recurrent CDI, 8 (75% female; median age 78.5 years [range, 25-86]) had 3 or more

UTI episodes the year prior and were included in the study. Prior to FMT, the median number of CDI episodes was 4 (range, 3-7), median number of prior metronidazole courses was 1.5 (range, 1-3), and median number of prior vancomycin courses was 3 (range, 1-5).
There was a significant decrease in the frequency of UTIs, from a median of 4 (range 3-7) episodes in the year before to 1 (0-4) episode in the year after FMT (P = .01; Wilcoxon signed rank test; Figure 1). Three patients with a single UTI episode after FMT were managed with either nitrofurantoin or trimeth- oprim-sulfamethoxazole. Two patients had 4 UTI episodes after FMT and were managed with intravesical gentamicin irriga- tions, which is a third-generation cephalosporin or ciproflox- acin. All patients had complete resolution of CDI and had no recurrences within 1 year of follow-up despite future antibiotic exposure.
Thirty-five positive urine samples were cultured in the year before FMT (Supplementary Table 1A), and 11 positive samples were cultured in the year after FMT (Supplementary Table 1B). Escherichia coli was the most common organism cultured from pre- and post-FMT urine samples followed by Klebsiella spe- cies. A total of 15 samples were positive for E. coli before FMT, whereas only 4 samples had E. coli cultured after FMT; 9 sam- ples were positive for Klebsiella before FMT and only 1 sample grew Klebsiella after FMT (Table 1).
Among 15 E. coli isolates before FMT, 4 (26.6%) were resist- ant to ampicillin, 3 (20%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin, and 3 (20%) were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Of the 4 E. coli isolates after FMT, only 1 (25%) was resistant to

ampicillin, and none were resistant to ciprofloxacin and tri- methoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Of the 9 Klebsiella isolates before FMT, 8 (88.8%) were resistant to ampicillin and 2 (22.2%) were resistant to nitrofurantoin. The only Klebsiella isolate after FMT was resistant to ampicillin but not to nitrofurantoin (Table 1).
Susceptibility profiling of the most recent urine cultures (UTI episode preceding FMT) from 8 patients grew E. coli or Klebsiella species (4 for each). Of the E. coli isolates, all 4 were resistant to ampicillin, 3 were resistant to ciprofloxacin, and 3 were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. After FMT, 1 of 4 isolates was resistant to ampicillin, but all were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Detailed resistance patterns for E. coli and Klebsiella are shown in Table 1.

Recurrent Clostridium difficile Infection and Recurrent Urinary Tract Infection Patients Not Managed With Fecal Microbiota Transplantation Of 8 patients in the control group (75% female; median age
85.5 years [range, 71-92]), 7 were managed with vancomycin and 1 with both vancomycin and metronidazole for their third CDI episode. Two patients had a subsequent CDI episode man- aged with a vancomycin taper. There was no difference in the fre- quency of UTI in the year before and after the third CDI episode. The median UTI frequency in the year before the third CDI was 4 (3-7) and in the year after it was 4 (2-9; P = .55; Wilcoxon signed rank test; Figure 1). There were no changes in antimicro- bial-resistance pattern comparing 13 E. coli isolates before the third CDI to 9 the year after or comparing the 10 Klebsiella iso- lates before the third CDI to 13 the year after. Detailed resistance patterns are outlined in Supplementary Table 2.


 		DISCUSSION
In this study, successful FMT for recurrent CDI was associated with a reduced UTI frequency and an improved antibiotic sus- ceptibility profile of organisms that cause UTIs. Commensal intestinal bacteria have an important role in pathogen coloni- zation resistance by competing for nutrients, altering gut pH, forming antimicrobial metabolites, and preventing access to binding sites on the mucosal wall [8]. The widespread use of antibiotics created a dysbiotic microbiome and impairs coloni- zation resistance, increasing the risk of MDRO colonization and CDI [9]. The need for repeated antibiotic courses may lead to both recurrent CDI and emergence of MDROs that cause UTIs; repeated treatment with antibiotics further disrupts the micro- biome, thereby perpetuating the cycle.
Microbial replacement therapies such as FMT are being investigated for treatment of conditions associated with a dis- rupted gut microbiome, including inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and metabolic syndrome [9]. It has been suggested that FMT might be effective in clearing VRE and MDROs by restor-

MDROs and decrease the risk of recurrent UTIs. Antimicrobial- resistance patterns from the isolates demonstrated an improved susceptibility to antibiotics after FMT, suggesting gut decolo- nization of MDROs or a reduction in concentration of these organisms below a threshold to cause UTI. Conceptually, FMT may have reduced colonization with multidrug-resistant E. coli clones such as ST131 sequence type in favor of less pathogenic
coli clones or other, largely commensal enteric organisms.
Although patients with a history of recurrent CDI are at high risk of recurrence of CDI on exposure to systemic antibiotics, none of the patients in this series experienced CDI recurrence, even after receipt of multiple courses of antibiotics for recurrent UTIs after FMT. However, the majority who received antibiotics were considered low risk for CDI. This suggests durability of response to FMT for recurrent CDI.
Although our findings are limited by a small sample size and lack of microbiome profiling, we demonstrate that FMT may decrease the frequency of MDRO UTIs, possibly by gut decol- onization through reestablishment of colonization resistance. This effect may lead to decreased antibiotic use, morbidity, and cost. A prospective clinical trial with a comparator non-FMT treatment group, microbiome data, and molecular typing of potential stool pathogens is needed to investigate the role of FMT in eradicating gut MDROs and reducing recurrent UTIs.
