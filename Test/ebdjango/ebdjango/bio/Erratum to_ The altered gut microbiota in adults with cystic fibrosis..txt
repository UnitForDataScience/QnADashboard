Erratum
In the original manuscript [ there  was a mislabelling  of the data resulting in Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes at phylum level being switched. This has  been  corrected  in the amended Figs.  and  below where before  you  had high levels of Actinobacteria; these are now corrected to Bacteroidetes. These amended figures show that there was   a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in the  relative  abundance of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Verruco- microbia, RF3, Tenericutes, and Lentisphaerae in individuals with CF at the phylum level, relative to the non-CF controls (Fig. ). Notably, there was a significant (p < 0.05) increase in Firmicutes in people with CF relative to the  controls (47% vs. 39% respectively). The overall conclusions in the manuscript remain unchanged.
