This study was conducted to investigate the effect of exogenous fecal microbiota transplantation on gut bacterial community structure, gut barrier and growth performance in recipient piglets. Twelve litters of Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire piglets of the same birth and parity were weighed and divided into two groups. One group (recipient piglets) was inoculated orally with fecal microbiota suspension of healthy adult Jinhua pigs daily from day 1 to day 11. The other (control) was given orally the same volume of sterile physiological saline at the same time. The experiment lasted 27 days. The results showed that the relative abundance of Firmicutes, Prevotellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcus, Prevotella, and Oscillospira in the colon of recipient piglets was increased. Proteobacteria, Fusobacteriaceae, Clostridiaceae, Pasteuriaceae, Alcaligenaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Veillonellaceae, Sutterella, Escherichia, and Bacteroides in the colon of recipient piglets were decreased. An average daily weight gain of recipient piglets was increased, and diarrhea incidence of the recipient was decreased during the trial. Intestinal morphology and tight junction barrier of recipient piglets were improved. The optical density of sIgA+ cells, the number of goblet cells and relative expressions of MUC2 in the intestinal mucosa of recipient piglets were enhanced. Protein expressions of b-defensin 2 and mRNA expressions of TLR2 and TLR4 in the intestinal mucosa of recipient piglets were also increased. These findings supported that the exogenous fecal microbiota had significant effects on animal's  growth performance, intestinal barrier function, and innate immune via modulating the composition of the gut microbiota.

INTRODUCTION
Intestinal microbial flora plays an important role in human and animal health, it has attracted more and more attention in recent years. Gut contains a tremendous amount of microorganisms, which makes a very big contribution to individual health. A healthy human intestine contains more than 1014 bacteria, which is 10 times the number of all cells in the body (, ). As it has a close relationship with absorption of nutrients, colonization resistance, development of the immune system and other functions in host, intestinal microbial flora is known as an essential



organ (, ). Although gut microbiota resides in the intestine, it can cause systemic effects (, ). Not only the intestine got affected by the change of gut microbiota diversity and balance, but the whole body system could get changed (, ). Diseases caused by imbalance of intestinal microbiota can be treated by treatments involving microbiota, such as probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and FMT (fecal microbiota transplantation) (, ). FMT refers to the transplantation of fecal suspension from healthy individuals into the gastrointestinal tract of the patient, in order to achieve the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. The first record about FMT was a Chinese physician named Ge Hong who used FMT to treat food poisoning and severe diarrhea in Jin Dynasty, so far, the medical profession has never stopped exploration and application of FMT technology. The first randomized controlled trial of FMT was reported in 2012, in contrast to vancomycin, infusion of donor fecal bacteria was significantly more effective in treating refractory recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (, ). In addition, it also became a tool for functional "knock-in" studies of the microbiota in animal models (, ). However, the connections between FMT, the structural changes of gut microbiota and improvements of intestinal health in recipients as well as the mechanism underlying these effects are not fully illustrated.
Intestinal microbiota of a newborn is in an unstable state,    its diversity increase gradually and is vulnerable to external environment and other factors  (,  ;   , ). Therefore, newborn piglets are usually used as a model, which can be a good animal model for studying human nutrition and physiology (, ;     , ). However, pig diarrhea can cause  sucking piglets  to die, which would bring significant economic losses to the   pig farm. Jinhua pig, one of the most well-known local breeds  in China, has the advantages of good meat quality, high rate     of reproduction and a better ability to resist the challenge of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) K88 and maintain the intestinal physiology homeostasis (, ). At the present study, newborn piglets were selected as the model, to explore the effect of exogenous fecal microbiota on animal health from the perspective of gut microbiota, intestinal physiological function and growth performance. We hypothesized that exogenous fecal microbiota transplantation would modulate the structure of the gut microbiota, improve intestinal barrier and immune function in newborn piglets. Therefore, this study might provide novel insights in understanding this efficient therapy strategy for various gastrointestinal diseases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preparation of Fecal Microbiota Suspension of Donor Pigs
Jinhua pigs with no antibiotics treated within 3 months were used in this experiment as fecal donors. The detection of hog cholera virus, porcine circovirus-2, porcine reproductive, and respiratory syndrome virus, pseudorabies virus, foot and mouth disease virus, swine erysipelas, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae in

donor pigs were negative. The fecal suspension was prepared as described by (), which was quickly aspirated and transferred to sterile Eppendorf tubes and stored at -80*C.
Transplantation of Fecal Microbiota Experiment and Animal Management
The present study followed the institutional and national guidelines for the care and use of animals. All animal management experimental procedures involving animal care and sampling were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Zhejiang University. A total of twelve litters (9-10 piglets per litter) of DLY(Duroc   Landrace   Yorkshire) piglets of the   same birth day and parity were weighed and divided into two groups from birth(each group had six pens with two pigs per pen). One group (recipient piglets) was inoculated orally with
1.5 ml fecal suspension daily from day 1 to day 11. The other (control) was given orally the same volume of sterile physiological saline at the same time. All piglets were breast-fed by sows and weaned at day 28. All of the piglets were inoculated orally using a syringe attached to a polyethylene tube at 6 am in the morning. The two groups were kept in two separate pig houses. And the conditions (temperature, humidity and other conditions) of the two pig houses were controlled consistently. The experiment lasted 27 days. Six piglets were randomly selected from each group and euthanized by sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight) at day 12 and day 27. Piglets were weighed individually at the start and end of the experiment, and average daily gain (ADG) was calculated for both groups. The number of piglets with diarrhea and its duration were observed and recorded during the experiment. Diarrhea was defined as liquid consistency over a minimum of 2 consecutive days. The incidence of diarrhea (%) was calculated as the total number of diarrheal piglets during the period divided by the total number of piglets multiplies duration of the trial.
Collections of Samples
Intestinal samples and colon contents were collected when the piglets were euthanized. For intestinal morphological analysis, the duodenal (about 5 cm from the pyloric-duodenal junction), mid-jejunal and ileal (about 10 cm from the ileal-caecal junction) segments were sampled and fixed in buffered formalin (10%)   at 4*C for morphometric analysis. Jejunum tissues were fixed overnight in a 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution at 4*C and then these samples were treated for observation by electron microscopy. The mucosa samples from the ileum and colon were harvested by scraping with a sterile glass microscope slide, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80*C for further analysis. Colon contents (from the middle of the colon) were collected from piglets. Digesta samples were placed into sterile polypropylene centrifuge tubes, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept frozen at -80*C until DNA extraction.
Extraction of DNA and 16S rRNA Amplicon Sequencing
Total DNA was extracted and purified from about 200 mg of individual colon contents using the QIAamp stool DNA Mini



kit (QIAGEN, United States) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing was performed at the Novogene Bioinformatics Technology Co. Ltd., Beijing, China. DNA was amplified by using the 515f/806r primer set (515f:5t-GTG CCA GCM GCC GCG GTA A-3t, 806r:5t-XXX XXX GGA CTA CHV
GGG  TWT  CTA  AT-3t).  PCR  reactions  were  carried  out  in
30  uL  reactions  with  15  uL  of  PhusionQR       High-Fidelity  PCR

Relative Expression of mRNA by Real-time PCR
The mRNA levels of TLR2, TLR4, and MUC2 were determined by real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted from ileum and colon mucosa using the TRIzolQR     Plus RNA Purification Kit following the manufacturer's guidelines. RNA was spectrophotometrically quantified and its integrity was verified by agarose gel

Master Mix (New England Biolabs); 0.2 uM of forward and
reverse primers, and about 10 ng template DNA. Thermal cycling consisted of initial denaturation at 98*C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 98*C for 10 s, annealing at 50*C  for 30 s, and elongation at 72*C for 30 s. Finally 72*C for          5 min. PCR products were purified by using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Dusseldorf, Germany). Sequencing libraries   were   generated   using   NEB   NextQR          UltraTM    DNA

electrophoresis. Reverse transcription using the SuperScriptTM
III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR was carried out following the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative analysis of PCR was carried out on a CFX384 real-time fluorescent quantitative  PCR  system  using  a  Power  SYBRQR        Green  PCR Master Mix, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers used were presented in . Each sample was repeated three times and the relative expression level of each

Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, United States) following
manufacturer's recommendations and  index  codes  were  added. The library quality was assessed on the Qubit@ 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Scientific) and  Agilent  Bioanalyzer  2100 system. At last, the library  was  sequenced  on  an Illumina HiSeq platform and 250 bp paired-end reads were generated.

Examination of Intestinal Morphological
The samples were embedded with paraffin wax and sectioned at 5 um on a rotary microtome. Then, the sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Villus height and crypt depth (V/C) were evaluated under a light microscope using a 1/100 ocular scale (Olympus, Japan). Morphological indices were determined using image processing and analysis system (Version 1, Leica Imaging Systems Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom) according to the technique of ().
The mid-jejunum specimen fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde was washed with phosphate buffer three times, then fixed with 1% OsO4 solution in (pH 7.0) for 2 h and washed with phosphate buffer (0.01M) three times. After that, the specimens were dehydrated by a graded series of ethanol (30, 50, 70, 80, 90, and 95% respectively). The segments were transferred to the mixture of alcohol and iso-amyl acetate (v:v    1:1) for 30 min, and    then transferred to iso-amyl acetate (100%) for 1 h. After being dehydrated with liquid CO2 by a critical point dryer (Hitachi Model HCP-2, Japan), the segments were coated with gold- palladium and observed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM, Philips Model TM-1000, Japan).

gene was analyzed statistically by 2-CT (,
).

Relative Expression of Protein by Western Blot
The protein expressions of b-defensin 2, MUC2, tight junction proteins: ZO-1 and Occludin in the intestine were determined  by western blot. Total protein extraction was performed using T-PER Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Pierce, 78510), protein quantification was then performed using the BCA Quantitation Kit. After the process of SDS-page electrophoresis analysis, transferred membranes, T-TBS (containing 5% non-  fat dry milk or BSA) was added to the membrane and blocked  at room temperature for 1 h. Antibody  (1:  100)  was  added  and incubated overnight at 4*C, then washing the membrane. Secondary antibody [Goat anti-Mouse IgG (H L)] was added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and then washed the  membrane.  SuperSignalQR        West  Dura  Extended  Duration Substrate was used for Western blot detection. The optical density of the bands was analyzed using Image J software. The b-actin was used as an internal control, which exhibited no difference between the groups. The relative abundance of each target protein was expressed as the ratio of target protein/b-actin protein.
Detection of Goblet Cells and sIgA+ Cells
The morphology and distribution of goblet cells in  the  intestinal epithelium were observed by light microscopy after the wax were stained with PAS according to the procedures

of (). Moditec camera software was applied to take pictures. 5-10 complete intestine villi were selected from each tissue slice, and the number of goblet cells of per 100 intestinal epithelial cells was counted. Moreover, ileum and colon tissue sections were stained by immunohistochemical method according to the procedures of (, ). The average integrated optical density of sIgA+ cells in the ileum  and colon mucosa was detected by using an image analysis system.
Statistics
According to the Barcode sequence and the PCR amplification primer sequence, the sample data were separated from the down- machine data, and the Barcode and primer sequences were cut off using FLASH (V1.2.7). The original Tags data (Raw Tags) was obtained after the sample was spliced. The spliced Raw Tags, need to undergo a rigorous filtering to get high quality Tags (Clean Tags). Refer to Qiime (V1.7.0), the flow of Tags Quality Control, the procedure as follows: (a) acquirement of Tags: The Raw Quality was cut off at the first low mass base from the continuous low mass (the default  quality  threshold was    19) to the set length (default length value was 3). (b)    The length filter of Tags: Further filtering out the value of which the continuous high quality base length is less than 75% of the length of the interceptive Tags. The sequences were clustered

into OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) with 97% consistency, and a representative sequence of OTUs was selected. Species annotation of OTUs representative sequences was performed with RDP Classifier method and Green Gene database. The Alpha diversity analysis included Shannon index and Chao1. Data were analyzed using the SAS statistical package (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, United States). Heatmaps were visualized using the R software, log 10 -transformation was applied on the bacterial relative abundance data matrix. Data are expressed as the mean SEM, and all mean values were tested using Student's t-test. A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

DISCUSSION
The structure of intestinal microbial flora is not only affected   by genetic factors, but is also susceptible to antibiotics, diseases, diets, environment as the starting early in life ( , ). Infancy is a key period of colonization of gut microbial flora, during which microbiota structure is unstable and susceptible to the surrounding environment (, ). In this study, DLY newborn piglets were selected to receive fecal microbiota transplantation from healthy adult Jinhua pigs. The results showed that the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria in the colon of recipient piglets was increased, moreover, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the two most abundant phyla of these piglets, and this result was similar to the previous study that Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes had an absolute








































advantage in mouse gut (, ). In this study, the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes was increased in recipient piglets, and the relative abundance of Firmicutes, Oscillospira, Prevotella was also enhanced. Firmicutes can maintain intestinal health by producing short-chain fatty acids, inhibit inflammation and provide energy for intestinal epithelial cells (, ). Firmicutes is also closely related to animal energy metabolism, and it is conducive to animal energy absorption of food under the condition that the proportion of Firmicutes is more than Bacteroides (, ). Oscillospira can use host glycans as a source of energy, Oscillospira is also probably associated with the production of the short-chain fatty acid butyrate (, ). Prevotella is associated with digestion of carbohydrates (, ). Veillonellaceae is associated with dietary intervention and pro-inflammatory (an increased abundance of Veillonellaceae was found in IBD, IBS, and cirrhosis patients) (, ; , ; , ; , ).
This study also showed that Escherichia of recipient piglets was decreased. Escherichia coli are a typically pathogenic

species that infects intestine, and causes diarrhea and other serious gastrointestinal  symptoms,  and  includes  types  such  as enterotoxigenic and enteropathic E. coli (, ). The above results suggested that intervarietal fecal microbiota transplantation increased the proportion of bacteria that benefit the host, and decreased harmful bacteria in the intestine of recipient piglets. Moreover, homology between the intestinal microbial flora of recipient piglets and donor  pigs were closer after FMT, though a portion of bacteria in recipient piglets did not change with the corresponding bacteria in the donor. Similar to the structure of microbiota composition in donor pigs, the relative abundance of Firmicutes, Prevotellaceae, Paraprevotellaceae, Prevotella of recipient was increased. For these bacteria, receptor piglets showed a donor-like succession, which is consistent with the previous reports (, ). The results also showed that Bacteroidaceae, Veillonellaceae, and Bacteroides of the recipient piglets were lower than the control, although it had a higher proportion in Jinhua  pigs.  Such shift phenomenon has also been reported in other studies (, ). It might be due to the complex interaction





























between microbial flora and colonization. Up to now, there were few studies about intervarietal fecal microbiota transplantation induced changes in the structure of intestinal microbial flora in pigs.
As the gut of a newborn pig is not fully developed, intestinal microbial floras are in an unstable  state.  At  the  same  time, the development of its immune system is not mature enough, thus  piglets  are  susceptible  to  a  variety  of  pathogens  (  , ) Piglets are weak in resistance, diarrhea would happen under this condition. Diarrhea would lead to the  decrease of survival rate and growth retardation of piglets. The proportion of Bifidobacterium would decrease, Enterobacterium, Bacteroides and Clostridium would increase when diarrhea happens (, ). Clinical practice trials showed that the patients with toxic megacolon caused by
C. difficile infection were treated by FMT successfully, and the frequency of diarrhea was decreased rapidly (,). The diarrhea incidence of recipient piglets was decreased significantly in this study. As mentioned  above,  Escherichia are connect with many diseases including diarrhea ( , ). It indicated that the decrease of diarrhea incidence might ascribe to the reduction of colonic Escherichia. Intestinal ecosystem of piglets is closely related to its growth characteristics (, ). The microbial structures of the heavier body weight piglets are different from the lighter ones (, ). The increase of bacteria mentioned above, which associate with nutrient absorption and metabolism might also lead to the weight gain of the recipient. Consistently, the piglets inoculated with fecal microbiota suspension performed better than the control piglets in this study, and the differences in  the  intestinal  microbial  composition  between  recipient and

donor led to the differences in their weight gain. Moreover, the decrease of diarrhea incidence might also contribute to weight gains of recipient piglets.
The development of intestine in newborn piglets is rapid, which include tissue growth, morphology changes and functions maturity. The villi capillaries  of  conventional  mice  were better developed compared to germfree mice, which suggested that  the  gut  microbiota   contribution   to   the   development  of the intestinal villi (, ). The  growth  rate  of  crypts affects growth and atrophy of the intestinal villi, the reduction of crypt depth indicate an increase of epithelial cell maturation rate and absorptive capacity. So the decrease of  crypt depth in recipient piglets in this study indicated the enhanced ability of absorption and digestion in the small intestinal epithelium. As shown  under  microscope,  jejunal  villi of recipient piglets were smooth with luminal integrity, while the control  group  showed  broken  luminal  integrity.  The scanning electron microscopes result indicated that that intestinal villus morphology was improved by fecal microbiota suspension.
The integrity of the intestinal barrier structure is the basis   for maintaining normal intestinal function. Tight junction is an important part of intestinal mucosa mechanical barrier function, which prevents bacteria and other antigens from spreading over the epithelial cells (, ). Tight junction proteins are often used  as  an  indicator  for  the  function  of  the barrier and the permeability in the intestine, including: occluding, ZO-1, and cladding. Improvements of intestinal barrier integrity were associated with tight junction proteins expression levels (, ). Microbiota can lead to the increase of tight junction proteins at cell boundaries, and










































prevent or reverse the harmful effect of pathogens in the intestine in some cases (, ). Studies have shown that probiotics can regulate tight junctions through bacterial metabolites (, ). The expressions of tight junction proteins in the intestine of recipients were increased in this study. As the first line of defense against intestinal microbial invasion host, goblet cells play a key role in the identification of intestinal microorganism (, ). Intestinal microbes can directly regulate the goblet cell function by delivering local biologically active factors. And the functions of goblet cells can also be changed by host-derived bioactive factors which are produced by active epithelial or underlying lamina propria cells after contacting with intestinal bacteria (, ). Intestinal goblet cells in the sterile-fed mice were fewer in number and smaller in  volume  as  compared  with  that  of the conventionally fed mice, which demonstrated that microbe regulates the number of goblet cells (, ). In the present study, the number of goblet cells in the

colon was higher than in jejunum both on days 12 and 27 which was consistent with the () report. From duodenum to the ileum, and jejunum, the ratio of goblet cells in all epithelial cells occupied 4, 6, and 12%. In the distal colon, the goblet   cells proportion increased to 16%. This coincides with a gradual increase in the number of microbes from the proximal intestine to the colon. Goblet cells mainly secrete making that cover intestinal epithelial surface, and play the role of mechanical protective barrier (, ). Mucins lubricate intestine and protect it from the damage of potential pathogens, mutagens, as well as mechanical and chemical damage (, ). The predominant gel-forming mucin in the intestine is MUC2, which could be expressed by goblet cells throughout intestine (, ). Without microbiota   in the intestinal tract, the thickness of the mucous layer will become thinner, and bacteria can contact with the epithelium directly, translocate and trigger the submucosal immune system to cause an immune response (, ; 




















































, ). Different bacteria species in the colon of mouse also led to the differences in mucin production capacity (, ). So in this study, the different structure of intestinal microbial flora may also cause the different expressions

of MUC2 in the intestine. The intestinal microbiota induced mucin production and antibiotic administration resulted in thinning of the mucus barrier, thereby increasing susceptibility to bacterial invasion (, ). The present study showed that mRNA and protein expressions of MUC2 were up-regulated in recipient piglets. The increase of MUC2 might be attributed to the increase of the number of goblet cells. The results indicated that the exogenous fecal microbiota suspension had a beneficial effect on the development of intestinal mucous barrier in recipient piglets. So in this study, intestinal morphology and intestinal barrier function was improved via intervarietal fecal microbiota transplantation.
There are a wide variety of antimicrobial peptides, which   aid congenital barrier resist microbial infection. As the first line of innate immunity in mammals, antibacterial peptides are a class of small molecules that are widely found in animals. The expression of b-defensin 2 gene is inducible and induced by intestinal microbes in the intestine of pigs (, ). The immune system of newborn piglets is imperfect, antimicrobial peptides are the key effector molecules of innate immunity at this stage. The expression of antimicrobial peptide gene in the intestine of mice increased gradually with age after birth (, ). b-defensin 2 increased gradually with age was also found in this study, the expressions of b-defensin 2 in ileum of recipient piglets on day 27 were higher than that of piglets on day 12. Moreover, the expressions of b-defensin 2 in recipient piglets were enhanced. The expressions




















































of defensin vary in breeds of piglets. It has been reported that the expression level of defensin gene in the intestine of Jinhua pig was higher than that in Landrace pig  (,  ). And they consider thatb-defensin play the key role during each stage of piglets growth and development that the expression ofb-defensin is different in  different  breeds  might  contribute to the various disease resistance of pigs. We found that the expressions of b-defensin 2 in recipient piglets were higher than

that of the control in this study. It indicated that intervarietal fecal microbiota promoted expressions of intestinal antimicrobial peptides in DLY recipient piglets. Increased expressions of antimicrobial peptide contributed to the improvement of the resistance of recipients to diseases.
As predominant immunoglobulin isotype on most mucosal surfaces (, ; , ), secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) can protect intestinal tract



from dietary and microbial antigens (, ). Except for  the  inhibition  of  adherence  and  invasion  of potentially harmful antigens into mucosa, sIgA also can neutralize toxins and virulence factors from microbial pathogens (, ). The innate inflammatory response of neonates is not mature enough to prevent pathogen invasion (, ). The relationship between microbes and sIgA is mutual adjustment. SIgA in the intestinal mucosa of mice that the intestinal microbial flora imbalanced caused by antibiotic were increased after receiving fecal microbiota suspension (  , ). The balance of original intestinal microbiota in recipient piglets would be disrupted after fecal suspension was treated and the optical density  of  sIgA+  cells  in  the  colon  was also increased in recipient piglets consistently. More and more bacterial colonization facilitates the maturation of mucosal immune system and is associated with the production of the large amount of sIgA, which stabilizes the microbiota-host interaction (, ). Exogenous fecal microbiota suspension stimulated proliferation of sIgA+ cells and the development of the intestinal immune system of piglets.
The composition of intestinal microbiota and  function  of  the immune system is closely related (, ). As a sensor for microbial infection, TLRs are critical    for initiation of inflammation and immune defense responses (, ). TLR recognized bacterial ligands that are not only unique to pathogens, but shared by all bacteria, and also produced by symbiotic microorganisms (, ). Previous studies have shown that intestinal microbiota can activate TLR2/TLR4 on the luminal surface of epithelial cells and may subsequently improve intestinal barrier function through promoting the assembly of intestinal tight junction- associated molecules as well as regulating  the  proliferation  and apoptosis of epithelial cells (, ; , ; , ). Stimulated by exogenous fecal bacteria, TLR2 and TLR4 of recipient piglets on day 12 were increased. As mentioned above, exogenous microbial flora might break the original balance of microbiota, therefore, TLRs in the intestine of piglets were significantly increased by the stimulation of exogenous fecal microbiota. However, there were no significant differences in the expressions of TLRs on day   27, which might indicate that intestinal microbiota of recipient

piglets was reestablished and the new homeostasis stablished. The activation of TLRs by commensal bacteria is essential for maintaining homeostasis in the colon ( , ). Sensing of commensal bacteria by TLRs in epithelial does not elicit an inflammatory cascade but is required for the maintenance of the epithelial barrier and contributes to TLR-dependent intestinal homeostasis observed in vivo ( , ; , ).  Moreover,  the induced TLR receptors in intestinal epithelium also can stimulate an innate immune response and activate the PP to secrete antimicrobial peptides (, ), and lead to the induction of MUC2 (, ). The study indicated that the expression of TLRs were up-regulated under the condition that intestinal microbial flora was imbalanced and didn't change when the structure of intestinal microbiota restored to steady state.
In summary, some characteristics of donor pigs could be transferred to recipient neonatal piglets by fecal microbiota suspension in this study. Exogenous fecal microbiota suspension changed  the  structure  of  intestinal  microbial  flora  as  well  as contributed to the improvement of  intestinal  morphology, the development of the intestinal mucosal barrier and innate immunity in recipient piglets. Therefore, the recipients' resistance to disease was enhanced, diarrhea was reduced and weight gain was raised. Fecal microbiota transplantation might be an efficient way to improve young animals' resistance to disease by changing the structure of intestinal microbial flora.
