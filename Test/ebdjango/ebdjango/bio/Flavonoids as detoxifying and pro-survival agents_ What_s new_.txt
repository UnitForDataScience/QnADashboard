The role of flavonoids in the survival machinery of cells has come in the spotlight due to the recent evidence of their effect on the relationship mitochondria-ER stress-proteasome, including the intracellular mechanisms of autophagy and apoptosis. Numerous experimental animal investigations and even human clinical studies have highlighted the major role of these natural compounds in the economy of life and their deep relationship with autotrophic organisms in the evolutionary space. Their role as anti-oxidant and oxidative stress preventive molecules has to date been investigated extensively in the literature. Despite this great amount of promising evidence, many concerns, however, remain, most of which dealing with biochemistry, bioavailability, phar- macokinetics, and interaction of flavonoids with gut microbiome, issues that make difficult any good attempt to introduce these molecules in the human healthcare systems as possible, encouraging therapeutic substances. This review tries to address and elucidate these items.




Introduction

In recent years flavonoids have become the major subject of ex- tensive investigations on cell survival and stress response, mostly due to their well-known health-promoting properties. Toxins that enter the body from the environment are transported into the liver or stored in tissues. In the organism, a complex assortment of various enzymes, mainly working in the liver, contribute to excrete and neutralize the different toxins and molecular stressors coming from diet and meta- bolism as bile salts, thanks to the major role of cholesterol. Compounds that stimulate the bile, like cynarine, increase the elimination of toxins from the bile into the digestive tract for elimination in the feces ( ). Due to its relationship with the gastrointestinal tract, the liver is a critical target for toxicity caused by drugs, xenobiotics, and oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from chemicals or drugs, which are exposed to liver cells, ap- pear to indirectly mediate liver injury, although the mechanisms of free radical toxicity in the liver are not yet well understood. Probably, it is important to understand the role of antioxidants during drug-mediated toxicity to discuss if they can be used to reduce oxidative stress caused by reactive intermediates produced by various drugs and chemicals, besides physical stressors ( ). Yet, ROS might be of major interest for their role as signaling molecules in adjusting the pro-survival mechanisms of

the cell, and this issue is a very recent novelty in the field. In this sense, quite recently researchers are wondering if ROS may help the cell to keep its survival activity, by acting as regulators in the modulation function of mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ().
Chronic ethanol intake (6 g/kg/day x 60 days) causes liver damage characterized by elevated biomarkers of liver dysfunction and a decline in liver glycogen (). The administration of ethanol-induced the activities of cytochrome P450 and cytochrome-b5 and reduced the activities of glutathione-S-transferase and cytochrome- c reductase. Moreover, ethanol has been shown to induce hepatocyte apoptosis and to reduce the viability of isolated hepatocytes (ex vivo) (). In general, flavonoids are considered as good free radical scavengers. The liver is a functional model of major importance to investigate the effect of xenobiotics and phytochemicals (flavonoids) in medicine. There are flavonoids for which this research appears particularly promising. For example, sily- marin has numerous pathways for hepatoprotective effects such as antioxidant activity. Silymarin has been found to be more effective than vitamin E in the liver of about ten times ( ). Furthermore, silymarin inhibits detoxification of cytP450 pathways and prevents metabolism of toxic integrates, including tetrachloride, acetaminophen and thioace- tamide (

 ). This evidence should encourage the study of plant-derived flavonoids as detoxifying agents. The poly- phenols could activate detoxification enzyme through the antioxidant/ electrophile response element (ARE/EpRE) in the promoter domain ( ). Interestingly, the effects that flavonoids, in general, have on enzymes depend on the levels the latter have inside the cell, their tissue distribution, and flavonoids bioactivity and bioavailability, besides their chemistry. Many flavonoids have low bioavailability orally, and the variation in the enzyme activity between different species can be considerable. Moreover, due to environmental and genetic factors, a great interindividual variability in drug- and xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes has been reported ( ). This review tries to address the state of art of flavonoids in medicine, taking into account new emerging hypotheses on their function.

An introduction to flavonoid biochemistry and function

As it is well known that flavonoids constitute a large class of che- mical compounds possessing a chromone (benzo (pyron) or similar open structure as the main chemical backbone). Depending on the positions of the benzene ring and substituents, flavonoids can be sub- grouped in several classes, the main of which is represented by an- thocyanidins, flavonols, isoflavonols, flavones, isoflavones, flavanones, isoflavanes, flavans, chalcones and dihydrochalcones ( ). Coumarins also are structural and functional closely related to the flavonoids (). The substituents of the flavonoid may be hydroxyl, methoxyl, ethoxyl or prenyl groups, and the hydroxyl groups may be conjugated with, for example, mono- saccharides, oligosaccharides, sulfates or phosphates. Therefore, they should be stored in the dark and at low temperatures. Most flavonoids are highly colored and emit lively and characteristic fluorescence colors, which is used for the identification and separation of them, for example by thin-layer chromatography or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Such methods are widely used among bota- nists for taxonomic classification of plants. (). Furthermore, they are easily oxidized, and they are efficient free radical eliminators. The latter property is utilized in many medical applications of flavonoids.

Flavonoid-rich food and medicinal plants

Flavonoids (more than 8000) represent the largest and most valu- able groups of polyphenolic integrates in fruits, cocoa, wine, vege- tables, and tea. They are very important parts of the daily human diet. Humans usually consume the largest amount of flavonoids via tea, onions, and apples (). These com- pounds are present in all green plant cells in which they carry important hormone functions (). It is therefore not surprising that flavonoids can also have hormone functions in animals. The most important function of the flavonoid in plants was originally considered an enhancement of the growth of the auxins by the increase of length (). This could happen by genetic induction or control of membrane pores, which otherwise al- lows indolyl-acetic acid to leave the cell. The detailed mechanism is not yet known, but it is believed that flavonoids inhibit the formation of COX2-dependent eicosanoids, leading to their well-known anti-in- flammatory property (). In the recent years, however, other hypotheses have been put forward ( ). The intake of flavonoids with a usual dietary habit for humans was initially estimated at 1-2 g/day, but recent studies show that the amount is much less (
). Therefore, their toxicity must be very low. This fits well with the

dietician's century-long recommendation for the population to consume abundant amounts of fresh vegetables and fruit daily, even though the deeper cause has only become apparent recently. Beneficial health ef- fects of flavonoids are mainly ascribed to their antioxidant activity ( ). However, recent studies highlighted the role of flavonoids in inducing ROS as signaling molecules in the modulation of cell sur- vival, mainly through the activity of mitochondrial and ER ( ). In this sense, one can explain how po- tentially toxic molecules such as flavonoids exert beneficial action on organisms. Many studies have suggested that flavonoids exhibit biolo- gical activities, including anti-allergenic effects ( ), antiviral (), anti- inflammatory ( ), vasoactive and cardiovascular protective action ( ). These pharmacological effects have been most frequently asso- ciated with the antioxidant properties of flavonoids; thug new evidence has emerged about their actual activity in a cell. The antioxidant ability was related not only to the flavonoids but also generally to the poly- phenols. This antioxidant activity is particularly difficult to be assessed in vivo. A further concern is the possibility that food components like flavonoids can change the metabolism of drugs in the human body (). Flavonoids consumed per os are hydrolyzed in the intestine of bacterial enzymes (e.g., fecalase) and about 15% of the aglycones (nuclei) are absorbed in the intestinal epithelium of bile complexes and chylomicrons ( ). Some of them are found in conjugates that have retained their antioxidant properties. The rest of the flavonoids leave the intestine with feces. Some of the fla- vonoids bind to serum albumin. The half-life of the flavonoid in the body is usually 2-3 h but may reach 18-28 h in some cases. The short residence time of the flavonoids in the body and their aglycones, poor water solubility are likely explanations of their low toxicity. The long- term toxicity of the flavonoids is very low as these substances do not accumulate in the body ( ). A lethal dose of flavonoids can only be obtained by compulsion of rats with these substances in pure form at an unrealistic high dose of >
1.0 g/kg body weight. In that case, hepatocyte membranes will break
down after exposure to this treatment for approximately three weeks (). However, some flavonoids may have a toxic effect on humans as specific antibodies to these substances have been found in patients' blood. This antigenic effect may cause allergy in patients (approximately 4% of the population) (). Some fla- vonoids, such as quercetin, exhibited another toxic effect in the bac- terial Ames test, namely mutagenicity, though not always confirmed (). The genotoxicity of flavo- noids may appear obvious, as plants produce these substances as a defense mechanism against phytopathogens, but not all the experi- mental reports seem to support this view in humans ( ). Some flavonoids have antimicrobial properties ().
However, the role of flavonoids in the cell biology might be much
more intriguing than expected before. Usually they enter the cell via the arylhydrocarbon receptors (ArHR) () and induce the formation of a low levels of ROS that helps mitochondria to oscillate between the pro-apoptotic activity and the pro-autophagic/pro-survival activity, depending on how much the cell is under stress and needs to be removed by an apoptotic event or "adjusted" by an autophagic me- chanism (). This subtle activity of low concentrated flavonoids might explain their pro-beneficial role in cell physiology and medicine ().
In addition, some widely used medicinal plants such as Aloe vera (Asphodelaceae) with luteolin, Betula pendula (Betulaceae) with quer- cetrin, Mentha longifolia (Lamiaceae) with luteolin-7-O-glycoside, Calendula  officinalis  (Compositae)  with  isorhamnetin,  Citrus  medica
(Rutaceae)   with   flavonoids   from   hesperidin,   Passiflora   incarnate




































Fig. 1. Reductive  summary  of  the pro-beneficial  effects  of  flavonoids  in a cellular  system  highlighting  fundamental concerns  and major  debated  issues. (1)  Flavonoids  entering  the cell through ArHR activate membrane-associated signaling systems and generate low levels of ROS, which (2) activate peroxisome-production of further ROS as signaling molecules and lately mitophagy. In the case of ER stress or an UPR mechanism, ROS elicited by flavonoids shift the chaotic oscillator made by mitochondria to pro-survival activities (such as mitophagy and autophagy), while when an excessive ROS production occurs, such as during calcium leakage from ER, apoptosis and NF-kB activation, are induced (4). This lead also to the activation of the expression of an anti-oxidant response and inhibition of JNK-dependent genes (5).

Insights on the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of main
flavonoids in humans

Flavonoids have a natural potential that is suitable for the catalysis of electron transfer in many biological redox processes. This is fa- cilitated by low activation energies for delivery and absorption of electrons in these reactions. As flavonoids are destroyed by oxidation, they lose an electron more easily than they absorb. The protection of biological reductants, especially ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is an im- portant characteristic of flavonoids ( ). Oxidation irreversibly destroys as- corbic acid, but the flavonoids are oxidized first. Thus, the flavonoids are consumed rapidly to destroy ROS. A high daily intake of flavonoids in the form of vegetables, fruits and beverages seem to be therefore entirely justified. Aldose reductase is an enzyme that can be significant
in certain pathological conditions, e.g., diabetes mellitus, glaucoma, although it has a low specific activity (). It can be

inhibited by flavonoids (). Flavonoids also modulate the activity of some protein kinases ( ). Therefore, flavonoids can save many patients at the high risk that accompanies vascular diseases (). Since HMG-CoA reductase is NADH-dependent, and flavonoids have a structure with 15-carbon skeleton, including two benzene rings linked through a heterocyclic pyrane ring ( ), the binding center of the flavonoid on the enzyme is probably the nucleotide backbone. Flavonoids influence many reactions medi- ated by folic acid. One example is the recovery of THF (tetra- hydrofolate) from DHF by reduction with ascorbic acid following one of the numerous oxygenase reactions. Oxygenases are a large group of oxidoreductases, for several reasons inhibited by flavonoids ( ), as follows:

They follow free radical mechanism, which is stopped by the radical extinction of the flavonoid effect.
They use THF as a catalyst of electron transfer, but its involvement can be prevented by flavonoids.
They also use pyridine and flavin nucleotides in their electron chain, but flavonoids can displace these prosthetic groups as a discussed

transfer.
All oxygenases contain iron (Fe) and copper (Cu) as essential com- ponents of their catalytic mechanisms, but flavonoids have a strong affinity for heavy metal ions. Therefore, redox potentials and dis- placements shift their positions in the active center. Also, their li- gand architecture is changed.

Examples of such oxygenases are cytochrome oxidase, xanthine oxidase, proline hydroxylase, prostaglandin cyclooxygenase, nitrogen oxide synthase and lipoxygenase ( ).

Biological activities of flavonoids and recent novelties

Role in ROS formation and in the oxidative stress response

Consumption of dietary antioxidants from plant materials has been associated with lower incidence of diseases due to the reduction of oxidative stress (). Polyphenolic compounds can function as an antioxidant and anti-prooxidant in the cell through scavenging of ROS by non-enzymatic and enzymatic reactions (     ). Their ability to act both as anti-oxidants and pro-oxidants, as well as pro- or anti-apoptotic molecules, depending on their dosage and cell biology, usually, if not damaged or not stressed.  sum- marizes the most recent highlights of flavonoid activity, i.e. when they acting as pro-oxidants elicit a mild stress (via ROS), which acts as a master tuner able to shift mitochondria oscillator towards survival gene expression, reduced ER stress and inhibition of apoptosis via the pro- motion of autophagy and mitophagy, whilst when acting as anti-oxi- dants they induce ROS to promote the activity of scavenging systems and anti-oxidant enzymes. In cancer and damaged cells, the pro-oxidant activity induces apoptosis and the inhibition of cell survival and re- plication, while the anti-oxidant property is often compromised ().
One of the characteristic properties of the flavonoids is their pro-
nounced ability to extinguish free radicals. This is an important aspect of the therapeutic uses of flavonoids, for example in cases of in- flammation (), infection ( ), burns () or damage caused by ionizing radiation (radioactivity) (). The ability to eliminate free radicals is closely linked to the redox po- tential and activation energy for electron transfer ( ). For the flavonoid, this connection has been dis- cussed initially by Halpern and Marcus (). Free radicals are formed by activating oxygen in macrophage during their immune response to an antigen. This process, which usually kills the invading foreign cell, e.g., bacterial, metastatic or virus-infected infectors, includes oxygenase type heme enzymes and flavin nucleotide- dependent oxygenases ( ). A single electron is transferred from one of the several available substrates, e.g., an amino acid, to the molecular oxygen to form superoxide. This aggressive free radical oxidizes double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids in the target cell plasma membrane to produce a free radical and trigger a chain reaction in which electrophilic sub- strates rapidly extinguish free radicals, and new ones are formed. Also, sulfhydryl groups and aromatics participate in this chain reaction. The immediate result is, among others, blasting of double bonds, which have become sensitive to oxidation by peroxidation, disulfide cleavage, oxidation of sulfhydryl groups and dimerization of thymine. Cell membrane will soon be unable to withstand the osmotic pressure dif- ference, a possible cause of its damage. Also, vital enzymes are in- activated, especially anabolic ones, and failure in gene expression oc- curs. Reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide radical, nitric oxide (NO*), singlet oxygen (1O2) and hypo-
chlorous acid (HOCl) react with biological molecules, causing cell and

tissue injuries. The ROS are considered to contribute to a wide variety of degenerative processes and diseases such as atherosclerosis, Parkin- son's disease, Alzheimer's disease and reperfusion injury of brain or heart ( ). Yet another toxin released by the macrophage oxidative out- break is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is a product of activated oxygen discharges by means of superoxide dismutase. Hydrogen sur- factant reacts with nitrogen oxide, *NO, which serves as a second messenger in many physiological activities, being also a neuro- transmitter and an immune modulator (). The product of hydrogen peroxide and nitrogen oxide is nitroso peroxy acid, which is an extremely effective oxidant and a strong acid ( ). Free radicals also accelerate the formation of eicosanoids, which have an internal dependence on the presence of such reactants, especially of the tyrosine radical ( ). Then, some eicosanoids, for example, prostaglandins, induce the expression of genes encoding en- zymes needed to remove damaged tissues (elastase and collagenase) or to trigger the repair processes. Some flavonoids destroy excess oxidants, stop the formation of pain releasing peptides, e.g., substance P and bradykinin, and stimulate macrophages. They thereby promote the re- covery of inflammatory tissue normal state ( ). Irradiation of biological tissue with X-rays, nuclear particles, and ionizing radiation leads to the cleavage of water molecules to hydroxyl (OH-) and hydrogen ions. In particular, the hydroxyl radicals are very harmful. Alkaline alcohols have been considered antidotes because they are effective, but the toxicity of their aldehyde products is significant. Flavonoids are readily irreversibly oxidized to hydroquinones, which are further oxidized to p-quinones in a reversible reaction. The latter is readily polymerized to a water-insoluble compound, which is no longer beneficial to the organism and therefore must be catabolized. The oxidation of the flavonoids is catalyzed by heavy metal ions and light ().
Through their pro-oxidant activity, flavonoids induce important
detoxifying enzymes, which have a beneficial function related to toxic chemical reactions ( ). Recent research has especially focused on the potential use of flavonoids in the treatment and prevention of dis- eases mediated by oxidative stress. Flavonoids can represent their an- tioxidant responses via different pathways such as by chelating metal ions, by quenching or scavenging free radicals, or by blocking free ra- dical production through enzymatic systems ( ). Research has shown that flavonoids can induce phase II detoxifying enzymes (e.g., glutathione S-transferase, NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase, and UDP-glucuronosyl transferase), which is crucial in the defense against oxidative stress and electrophilic toxicants. A number of genes that encode phase II enzymes have a regulatory sequence, an electrophile responsive element (EpRE). The redox properties of the flavonoids correlate with their EpRE mediated response ().

Activity on mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress

The activity of flavonoids on mitochondrial and ER stress is parti- cularly insightful and intriguing. Intracellular pathways have a sig- nificant role on different cell stress signals that could promote an im- balance of the proteins of the Bcl-2 family in various pathways such as mitochondrial permeabilization with concomitant release of cyto- chrome c (Cyt-c), apoptosis and eventual activation of caspase 9 ( ). On the other hand, the contribution to the oxidative da- mage caused by ROS, mainly produced in the mitochondria, should not be excluded, since superoxide (*O2-), hydroxyl radicals (*OH), and hy- drogen peroxide (H2O2) are potent oxidant species (). It has been demonstrated that the ER is sensitive to oxidative stress da- mage and modulates the cell death induced oxidative stress (
). In particular, a balance should exist between the activity

of mitochondria, which would act as a "chaotic oscillator" and the level of cell-induced ROS. In an early pro-oxidant activity of flavonoids, ROS should help mitochondrial oscillator to turn towards the activation of survival functions and modulate ER stress to activate those mechanisms deputed to the clearance of misfolded and dysfunctional proteins (  ), a me- chanism where also peroxisomes have a fundamental role (   ) (see also ).
Also, ER-stress could promote the accumulation of misfolded and unfolded proteins in the ER and stimulates the unfolded protein re- sponse (UPR), inducing cells to adapt to harmful stimuli under phy- siological conditions (). However, since the stress condition is unresolved, the UPR becomes a pro-apoptotic response (). It is revealed the flavonoid such as cirsimaritin could affect ER stress and down-regulate the phosphorylation of Akt in the human gallbladder carcinoma GBC-SD cells, indicating cirsimaritin-in- duced ROS as a primary action that induces ER stress mitochondrial apoptosis (). Also, kaempferol as a natural flavonoid triggers apoptotic pathways through the ER stress and mitochondrial- dependent pathway in human osteosarcoma U-2 OS cells ( ). Moreover, 7-{4-[Bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino]-butoxy}-5-hy- droxy-8-methoxy-2-phenylchromen-4-one (V8), which is a synthetic flavonoid, stimulates in hepatocellular carcinoma apoptosis via the ROS mediated ER stress pathway (). 3',5-dihydroxy-3,4',7- trimethoxyflavone (DTMF), a semi-synthetic derivative of quercetin, trigger ROS-mediated oxidative stress, which in turn activates JNK and PERK-CHOP pathways of apoptosis and consequently promotes the death of HCT-116 colon cancer cells (). Further, it can induce mitochondrial apoptosis in hepatic stellate cells through the activation of ER stress (). Stimulation of flavonoid-in- duced apoptosis is generally induced by elevated dosage of flavonoids or if these phytochemicals act on damaged, highly stressed and in- flamed cells, such as tumors.

The role of flavonoids in autophagy and apoptosis

Two common forms of programmed cell death (PCD) are apoptotic (type I) and autophagic cell death (type II) (). Autophagy is a degradative cellular process that plays a major role in maintaining homeostasis and preventing nutritional, metabolic, or in- fection-mediated stresses through acting as a housekeeper to clear da- maged organelles such as misfolded or aggregated proteins, eradication of damaged organelles and proteins, and elimination of foreign mi- crobes such as viruses through a lysosomal degradative pathway (). Further, it has been found that autophagy is involved in cancer, cardiomyopathy, neuro- degenerative diseases, as well as immune defense, cell differentiation, and cell death (). Recently, indirect mechanisms of flavonoids for protective effects, including induction of antioxidant responsive element, Keap1/Nrf2/ARE, as well as autophagy, were stu- died (). For example, curcumin, a biologically active polyphenolic compound found in turmeric and tetrahydrocurcumin as well as bisdemethoxycurcumin stimulate autophagy very effectively (). It has been shown that mechanisms of initiation of autophagy by tetrahydrocurcumin are through regulation of PI3K/Akt_mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways in human leukemia HL-60 cells (). Also, curcumin could inhibit G2/M and autophagy in malignant glioma cells by control of the Akt/mTOR/ p70S6K and induction of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 mechanisms (). On the other hand, fla- vonoids could reveal anti-cancer activities via the regulation of autop- hagy. For example, plant flavonoids, such as silibinin could in human MCF7 breast cancer cells stimulate autophagy through ROS-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction and ATP loss that involve BNIP3 (
). Also, wogonin and luteolin, have been revealed cancer cell

death via the modulation of autophagy ( ). Moreover, some natural polyphenolic compounds, in- cluding curcumin, genistein, quercetin, rottlerin, and resveratrol could induce type II programmed cell death through various approaches by the canonical (Beclin-1 dependent) and non-canonical (Beclin-1 in- dependent) mechanisms of autophagy (). Although, as indicated above, phytochemicals participate in the finest mechanisms of modulation of the relationship autophagy(mitophagy) and apoptosis, via mitochondria-ER and also proteasome ( ), these compounds are mostly known as disturbing the cell cycle, triggering apoptosis, preventing tumor cell metastasis, potentiating the functions of chemotherapeutic agents, inducing au- tophagy, and activating antitumor effects in vivo, thus suggesting fla- vonoids as promising anti-cancer agents.

Role in inflammation and immunity

Haptens like flavonoid aglycones are only antigens when bound to macromolecules, especially serum albumin and lipoproteins, as the aglycones are hydrophobic substances. The aglycones are only weak antigens (). Several reports have been published on the specific activation of cytotoxic and NK-T lymphocytes (natural killer, T8 cells) of flavonoid ( ). However, no single mechanism has been found that can explain this phenomenon. Fundamentally, it has been assumed that is caused by the inhibition of COX (cyclooxygenase)-dependent pros- taglandins, which may inhibit T lymphocytes function and migration (). Given the importance of T8 lymphocytes for the immune system's delayed response to invading foreign cells, such as metastases, bacterial cells or virus-infected cells, it is also reasonable to consider indirect mechanisms. Although T-cells circulate in the per- ipheral blood, they rarely recognize antigens directly. Instead, they receive signals from macrophages and other cells. NK-T cells are known to be activated in the human peripheral blood of flavone acetic acid (). Flavonoids may interact with immunoglobulins and probably enter macrophages and innate immune cells via immunocomplexes and their membrane receptors. (). It is known that flavonoids interact with both protein phosphokinases and transport A- TPs, i.e., with enzymes that are crucial in the homeostatic regulation of cells (). Such disturbance may stress mac- rophages to trigger the formation and secretion of cytokines. These alert the immune system so that a timely defense is established. Quercetin inhibits lysosomal secretion, arachidonic acid metabolism, and in- tracellular Ca2+ in rabbit neutrophils ( ). Several cell types form and excrete interferons. Flavonoids promote this production. In this way, another part of the immune system is activated ( ). Although flavonoids are known to modulate the activity of protein phosphatases that contribute to gene expression and protein translation regulation, their main effect seems to be alerting macrophages (). Flavonoids are also able to inhibit the anaphylactic reaction, for example in IgE- sensitized RBL-2H3 cells, several flavonoids decreased production and release of histamine, b-hexosaminidase, and inflammatory regulators (interleukin-4, prostaglandin D2, leukotriene C4, and tumor necrosis factor-a), decreased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and 5-lipox- ygenase, and inhibited activation of nuclear factor-kB ( ).

Highlights on the protective role of flavonoids

Hepatoprotective and detoxifying activity

Flavonoids with phenolic structures have been shown effective in the management of different liver disorders. Pretreatment of rats with

Echinops extract containing three flavonoids named silymarin, rutin and quercetin before the hepatotoxins agent (CCl4) induce a hepato- protective action (). Carbon tetrachloride (C- Cl4) induced hepatocyte damage in vitro and liver injury in vivo (    ). It explores the action mechanisms of hepatotoxic effects, including fibrosis, fatty degeneration and hepatocellular death ( ). A study revealed that total flavonoids extracted from flowers of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medic could protect mice against CCl4-stimulated liver injury via anti-inflammatory and antioxidant stress activities (). Quercetin is a flavonoid compound that plays a crucial role in the liver against DNA damage. It is stimu- lated through acrylamide toxicity in rats, suggesting alleviating acry- lamide-stimulated changes in the rat liver ().
Isoquercitrin protected the liver from acetaminophen-induced in-
jury by inhibition of inflammation, nitrosative stress and oxidative stress, as well as modulation of acetaminophen metabolism, revealing the potential hepatoprotective agent of isoquercitrin (). On the other hand, metallothioneins (MT) has been proposed to play a significant role against acute heavy metal toxicity in the liver, and the MT proteins can be stimulated by different stimuli such as an anti- oxidant. Measuring the induction of MT genes could suggest an efficient approach for revealing the chemopreventive mechanisms of flavonoids. Quercetin as a member of the flavonoid family can stimulate the ex- pression of phase II detoxifying enzymes, including NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), heme oxygenase (HO)-1, and glutathione S- transferase (GST) (). Moreover, flavonoids can inhibit carcinogenesis and DNA damage in cells by preventing of the metabolic induction of the pro-carcinogens that contributed to phase I enzyme (predominantly cytochrome P450), or activation the detoxification of carcinogens through stimulation of phase II enzymes (). These compounds showed var- ious effects such as in vitro antioxidant activities, ROS scavengers, chelators  of metal ions and free radical reaction  terminators  (   ).

Action on neurodegenerative disorders

Flavonoids are well-known as polyphenolic compounds that re- present neuroprotective effects in preclinical models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), stroke, and Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as in glial cells and neurons in cultures and in vitro models of neurodegenerative diseases (). Proposed trials have displayed that addicted intake of dietary flavonoids decreases the risk of dementia (), stroke ( ), and PD (). It is revealed that diverse activities such as transition metal chelation, free radical scavenging, stimulation of signaling pathways and survival genes, modulation of mitochondrial actions, and regulation of neuroinflammation could induce these posi- tive effects in neurodegenerative diseases in human, neuroprotection against disease-related relevant insults in rodents, and improvements in cognition and learning in animal model ( ). Also, in a study, western blot analysis showed that quercetin dramatically stimulates the induction of two major cell survival kinases such as Akt and protein kinase D1 (PKD1) in MN9D dopaminergic neuronal cells. Also, PKD1 acts as an upstream regulator of Akt in quercetin-mediated neuroprotective signaling, indicating as a potent neuroprotective agent for treating PD and other oxidative-stress- related neurodegenerative disorders (). Also, in nu- merous studies the neuroprotective activities of Citrus flavonoids ( ), silymarin (), naringin ( ), baicalein (5, 6, 7-trihydroxyflavone) (), rutin (quercetin-3-O-rutinoside) () and apigenin ( ) have been demonstrated. Moreover, it has been suggested that flavonoid-enriched diet could target complementary molecular processes, may stimulate synergistic interactions allowing the use of the
lowest possible amount of different flavonoid compounds and thereby

decreasing the adverse side effects, thus representing promising ap- proaches as novel therapies for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.

Action on metabolic syndrome

Flavonoid-rich diets, as well as pure flavonoids, were evaluated to prevent and/or alleviate of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and MetS-as- sociated diseases (). It is important to evaluate the effects of dietary flavonoids on MetS in a very complex matrix such as the multiple biological targets involved in the onset of these risk factors, the risk factors defining the MetS and the number of flavonoids as well as their metabolites. It is proven that flavonoids such as quercetin could be effective in the alleviation of metabolic disorders, including meta- bolic syndrome and obesity. Several approaches have been suggested to display these health effects (), e.g. the partial mediation by combination of quercetin and a stilbene resveratrol a type of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidized (NAD+)-dependent protein deacetylases and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosyl- transferases known as sirtuins (SIRTs), the latter ones block differ- entiation of preadipocyte, stimulate adipocyte apoptosis, decline adi- pocyte proliferation, stimulate fatty acid (FA) b-oxidation, lipolysis, and thermogenesis, and decrease lipogenesis ( ).
Quercetin and quercetin-containing cherry and apple extracts have
effective roles in the blood glucose concentration, hepatic metabolism, and gene expression patterns in obese C57BL/6J high fat-fed mice (). On the other hand, the critical role of flavonoids reverting/preventing insulin resistance has been proposed by develop- ments in numerous of these parameters in animal and human models of supplementation with different flavonoids ( ). Also, in subjects with risk factors associated with MetS, supplemented diets with flavonoids could lead to a decrease in blood pressure effects in rat models because of high NO bioavailability and enhanced endothelial function ( ).

Action on cardiovascular disorders

Flavonoids are known as dietary polyphenolic compounds with a broad range of established beneficial cardiovascular effects ( ). Clinical and pre-clinical evidence, as well as epidemiological study, propose that presented flavanones significantly effect on the cardio-metabolic features, inhibiting cardiovascular disease as well as cardiovascular disease mortality and risk factors ( ). The effects of flavonoids on hypertension are well-known and proposed that mechanistically related to bioavailability regulated of NO through the induction of NOS and/or the inhibition of nitric oxidation (). In a meta- analysis of three randomized clinical trials with 233 patients, some authors highlighted the association between reduction in blood pres- sure and grapefruit intake (). The proposed me- chanisms for the responsible action of the cardiovascular benefits from Sitrus flavanones were associated with anti-oxidant and anti-in- flammatory action, vasodilator, anti-ischemic activity as well as glucose tolerance (). Moreover, microvascular re- activity and inflammatory status in men at risk of cardiovascular dis- ease could be improved with flavonoid-rich fruit and vegetables ().

Anti-cancer and chemopreventive activity

By focusing on anticarcinogenic effects, it has been identified that flavonoids and other polyphenols have many mechanisms of action against cancer (). They include carcinogen inactivation, cell cycle arrest, antiproliferation, differentiation and

induction of apoptosis, antioxidation, inhibition of angiogenesis, in- duction of detoxification enzymes, reversal of multidrug resistance, maintenance of genomic stability, and regulation of the host immune system. Not only one but also rather a combination of different me- chanisms is expected to result in both chemotherapy and cancer che- moprevention (). Chemother- apeutic drugs used in the cancer treatment may interact with flavonoids through metabolic inhibition or induction ( ). The role of the flavonoid as adjuvants is to induce the cancer cells sensitivity to the induction of apoptosis. The reason is that cells in stress activate the expression of heat shock proteins, which drastically reduce the effect of the apoptotic drugs ( ). Flavonoids, e.g., quercetin, inhibit the expression of the heat shock proteins by a trans-effect (re- mote effect) pathway. Since the toxicity of flavonoids is very low, their use in cancer treatment should be considered ( ). It has also been reported that flavonoids have an anti- metastatic activity that inhibits the activation of procarcinogens, partly because of the inhibition of aromatase () by flavonoid and because they protect DNA from peroxidation ( ). Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are critical for the activation of phase II enzymes and procarcinogens that are crucial for the detoxification of carcinogens (). A number of naturally occurring flavonoids modulate the CYP450 system. The effect of the phenolic integrates such as chlorogenic acid, gallates, protocatechuic acid, tannic acid, as well as silybin on ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (CYP1A1), pentoxy-O-deal- kylase (CYP2B), and methoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (CYP1A2) was evaluated in liver microsomes of mice from stimulated animals. All phenolic integrates examined may control the activity of cytochrome P450-regulated enzyme but to different extents ( ). Flavones (baicalein, chrysin, and galangin), isoflavones (biochanin A and genistein), and flavanones (naringenin) inhibit the activity of aromatase (CYP19). They produce anti-estrogenic effects and decreases estrogen biosynthesis, which is important in prostate and breast cancers. The activation of phase II detoxifying en- zymes such as glutathione S-transferase, quinone reductase, and UDP- glucuronyl transferase, by flavonoids, detoxify the body for carcino- gens. Different flavonoids including galangin, fisetin, quercetin, genis- tein, and kaempferol represent potent noncompetitive inhibitors of sulfotransferase 1A1 (or P-PST), which represent a potentially im- portant chemopreventive mechanism for sulfation-induced carcino- genesis (). The flavonol quercetin is the most common dietary flavonoids having in cultured animal cells various biological  properties,  including  cytoprotection  and  anti-tumorigenic
effects (). The effective roles of quercetin on induc-
tion of major phase II detoxification systems, NAD(P)H: quinone oxi- doreductase (NQO1) in the MCF-7 cell line, have been recently in- vestigated. By treating MCF-7 cell lines with 15 mM for 24 h quercetin resulted in a twofold increase in enzyme activity and levels of NQO1 protein, and a three-to fourfold increase in mRNA expression of NQO1 (). The elevated transcription of the NQO1 protein following quercetin treatment proposes the ef- fective role of dietary plant polyphenols in the induction of transcrip- tion of phase II detoxifying systems, probably by antioxidant response element-dependent approaches. Stimulation of the human NQO1 gene through the dietary polyphenolics may induce protection responses for carcinogenic  chemicals via the antioxidant response element (   ).

Heavy metal detoxification

One of the characteristic properties of flavonoid is their high affinity for heavy metal ions, which is dependent on the number and position of free phenol and/or enol groups in the molecule. Because the ionized
forms of heavy metals are the most dangerous, and since heavy metal

poisoning is a relatively common task in the metal industry and in developing countries, flavonoids could be a useful help. Currently, water-insoluble polymers equipped with sulfhydryl groups are used to treat such patients. As the latter are administered per os, they are only absorbed to a very small extent and are therefore not particularly ef- fective in treating systemic poisoning. Heavy metals are accumulated in the liver from which they could be mobilized by flavonoid aglycones, transferred to the blood and removed by replacement transfusion or by percolation through columns packed with dextran having been supplied with sulfhydryl groups or flavonoid aglycones as substituents ( ). The problem with a flavonoid treatment of heavy metal poisoning is that many enzymes require the presence of heavy metal ions in their active centers. Such enzymes could be in- activated with potentially engaging consequences. Experiments with cell culture and experimental animals must clarify such relationships ().

More about the flavonoid activity on organisms

Some flavonoids, e.g., silymarin, have a weak estrogenic effect. The reason for this estrogenic effect is that the spatial position of the hy- droxyl groups happens to be almost identical to that in estradiol ( ). Estrogen flavonoids are also present in soybeans and products thereof (). Several flavonoids inhibit hyaluronidase. This enzyme facilitates spermatozoa penetrate into oocytes at hydrolysis of mucopolysaccharides in oocyte coat. The barrier prevents egg cell fertilization. A further effect of the inhibition by flavonoids of hyaluronidase is that it counteracts the spread of in- fections through it loose connective tissue ( ) and contribute to the protection of capillary permeability. Fla- vonoids have also been used to treat hemorrhoids (). Their effect could be due to a reinforcement of the car walls by in- hibition of hyaluronidase (). A synthetic flavonoid- like substance, sodium cromoglycate administered as a nasal aerosol, is one of the medicine's first uses of a flavonoid. It was introduced for more than 60 years ago. The reason for the use of flavonoids for the treatment of allergy is the inhibition of the formation of eicosanoids that play one of the central roles in the sensitive cellular immune system (). It is revealed the in- hibition by flavonoids of degranulation of mast and basophilic cells ().

Concluding remarks

Flavonoids have a potential as drugs of increasing interest in many medical subjects. However, at present, the flavonoids are considered mainly as food additives with possible human physiological effects being investigated. Approx. 20 of the flavonoids that have the greatest medical interest are already on the market. Pharmacology has so far concentrated work on dangerous plant toxins and synthetic substances that were considered as drugs. On the other hand, little attention has been paid to low toxicity natural substances, which are regularly con- sumed in low doses as constituents of the normal foodstuffs. The fla- vonoids belong to the latter category. This choice is justified by the high costs of a pharmacological study and of the obligation to protect the population against potentially fatal acute poisoning. However, since the long-term effects of the ingestion of substances of low toxicity can harm the health, e.g. upon accumulation in the liver or by triggering an im- mune response, there is a growing increase in demanding to focus at- tention on these substances.
New data strongly suggest that the role of flavonoids should appear
much more intriguing than expected. They can act as fine tuners of the fundamental role exerted by mitochondria and ER in cell stability of its function and survival. Furthermore, the functional association between
flavonoids and autophagy in flavonoid treated cancer cells with the understanding their mechanisms should be further studied. Also, the

capability of natural polyphenolic compounds to stimulate autophagic cell death that increases the effects of standard therapies should be evaluated for designing new therapeutic approaches in the treatment of cancer. Also, in vitro approaches are hotly demanded in the evaluation of biochemical mechanisms and for the elucidation of different potent bioactive candidates. Accurate bioavailability and metabolism me- chanisms of flavonoids after oral ingestion, the use of cell models for intestinal absorption still need to be further studied. Moreover, ther- apeutic administration of novel flavonoids should be validated by specific biochemical tests and the possibility of genetic modifications for production of flavonoids at large scale could be evaluated. Further studies will provide better vision and will certainly create opportunities for novel flavonoid based pharmaceutical agents for the treatment of various infections, allergic, inflammatory, and degenerative diseases.
