Abstract

This special issue of Research in Microbiology aims to provide some insights in one of women's most fascinating interacting microbial communities: the vaginal microbiome. Even in the 21st century, with many advanced methods at hand, the definition of the healthy vaginal microbiome remains under debate. The interest in studying the dysbiosis of the vaginal microbiome is increasing and goes well beyond the study of bacterial vaginosis. The selection of contributions in this issue summarizes what is currently known in terms of inter- and intra- microorganisms interaction as well as the virulence factors that some of them may deploy.

Introduction

While the proportion of human and microbial cells in humans is a subject of debate in the scientific literature, re- searchers unanimously agree on the importance of microor- ganisms in humans . Animal and human bodies live with billions of microorganisms as a result of millions of years of co-evolution . Each healthy subject possesses a specific and dynamic subset of hundreds of species which provides all the microbiota-dependent features fundamental to the human body's physiology and health, i.e. development and growth, immunity, metabolism and even psyche .
Human microbial ecosystems, characterized by dense pop- ulations of highly interconnected networks of microbes, are found in the nose, mouth, throat, large intestine, skin, urethra and vagina. It has been estimated that the wet weight of the human body's microbiomes is around 2.5e3.0 kg and that bacterial populations vary, from 102 to 106 cells per cm2 on the skin up to 1011e1012 cells per gram of colon content .
The microorganisms that make up the microbiome may be symbionts living in complete harmony with the host and with

mutual benefit: they may be commensals, benefitting from the association with the host, others may be pathobionts, which are symbionts that can cause disease under particular condi- tions, and some may be parasitic, harming the host and causing disease. Inflammation is activated if the symbiotic balance is disrupted and pathobionts and/or pathogens predominate.
Although a common core of microbiomes, defined as the collective genome of the microbiota or microflora, is gained during birth, the individual microbiome is specific, leading to a microbial fingerprint. In humans, a number of the common core bacterial genera, i.e., Lactobacillus, Prevotella and/or Sneathia, may be acquired during vaginal delivery  and possibly by breastfeeding . Other microorganisms may be inhibited or enhanced by these core bacteria, further defining the microbiome .
The vaginal canal consists of layers of stratified squamous epithelium covered by mucus. It is a highly nutrient-rich environment supporting the development of a unique microbiome. This eubiotic vaginal microbiome is marked by its relative simplicity compared to other econiches in and on the human body, consisting of a few species of dominant lactobacilli and temporal dynamic changes in the abundance of lactobacilli and other species. Overall, the vaginal

microbiome is mostly bacterial, with anaerobic micro- aerophilic properties. Ever since the initial study of the human vaginal econiche by Albert DEURoderlein in the late 19th century, lactobacilli have been shown to be the key constit- uents of a healthy vaginal microflora . They produce lactic acid, lowering the pH and rendering the vagina a hostile environment for many pathogens. In addition, they produce bacteriocins and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) e although the importance of the latter has been minimized (see also Tachedjian et al., this issue ) and compete for nutrients, contributing to the inhibition of growth of other microor- ganisms and thus protecting the vaginal environment against sexually transmitted infectious agents and overgrowth by aerobes and anaerobes . The low pH probably has little effect against acid tolerant lactic acid bacteria such as group B streptococci (see also Cools and Melin, this issue ) or against Candida (see also Cauchie et al., this issue ).
Another important role of the vaginal microbiome con-
sists of the seeding of infants with microbial ecosystems during natural vaginal delivery. Neonates are exposed to a diversity of microbes during birth, acquiring their initial microbiota by contact with the mother's vaginal and fecal microbes . This is in contrast to children born through cesarean delivery who acquire their initial microbiomes through skin contact with their mother and caregivers and from the environment . Although research is still ongoing, recent studies showed that C-section birth disturbs the mi- crobial alpha diversity of the infant's gut . This decreased diversity may hamper the training of the immune system and the natural development of immune homeostasis, leading to defects in mucosal tolerance and later development  of asthma, allergies, autoimmune diseases and type I diabetes . Decreased diversity has also been related to meta- bolic malfunctions such as obesity . However, this field has to be further explored to understand the impact of the initial contact with microbiota and microorganisms on dis- ease prevention and health promotion during the child's lifetime .
In this special edition, we provide an overview of selected microbial organisms which may influence the vaginal eco- niche and impact women's and neonate's health. We focus on the alteration or dysbiosis of the vaginal microbiome caused by the predominant presence of pathobionts or overgrowth of commensals. Virulence factors that organisms may use to in- crease their chance of survival and to evade the hosts' immune systems, such as cooperative activities, e.g. biofilm formation and symbiosis with viruses and Mollicutes and morphology changes, e.g. hyphen formation are discussed.
This issue does not cover sexually transmitted pathogens such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis, because a vast amount of literature already exists on these topics. However, a paper on the widely neglected protozoon Trichomonas vaginalis has been included, as the findings on symbiotic intracellular co-infection of the parasite with Mol- licutes and/or viruses illustrate the impact of unusual micro- bial cooperation on the pathogenicity of the parasite and its effect on the vaginal microbiome in general.

The healthy vaginal microbiome

For over a century, it has been established that, under normal or healthy conditions, the vaginal econiche is monopolized by lactobacilli. This was already obvious from the microscopy studies of DEURoderlein, 1894 and SchrEURoder, 1921  e as illustrated by the cover page of this special issue. During the last decades, culture-based [e.g. ] and non-culture-based qualitative and (semi-) quantitative molec- ular techniques, such as cloning and sequencing  and qPCR e, showed that a limited number of Lactobacillus species, i.e. Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus jensenii and Lactobacillus vaginalis, dominate the vagina during eubiosis. This is addressed in more detail in this issue by Vaneechoutte . However, on the basis of one high-throughput sequencing (HTS) study, it was suggested that we consider as normal any type of vaginal microbial community (VMC), including those whereby lactobacilli are absentdbecause in the absence of lactobacilli and their replacement by a species-rich consortium it remains asymptomatic in half of the cases, because all produce lactic acid and because non-lactobacillar VMC may be even more stable during the menstrual cycle . This idea should be considered with caution, for several reasons. First, numerous studies have established a link between vaginal dysbiosis (mostly referred to as bacterial vaginosis (BV)), regardless of whether it is symptomatic or not, and vulnera- bility for sexually transmitted infections (STI) and adverse pregnancy outcome (APO). Therefore, we should not dismiss out of hand knowledge concerning vaginal eubiosis and BV that has been gathered and cross-validated on the basis of microscopy, culture- or non-culture-based molecular tech- niques, because of the advent of a new technique such as HTS. Second, even among different types of Lactobacillus-domi- nated VMCs, there appear to exist strong differences with regard to their protection against STI and against APO . Third, it can strongly be questioned as to how stability should be defined, and whether it should be taken as a hallmark of eubiosis. Although women may retain lactobacilli during menses, the normal pattern is that of a decrease or even the disappearance of some lactobacilli during menses and after sexual intercourse, i.e. the existence of a very dynamic pattern for women with normal VMC. Moreover, stability is a hall- mark of chronic BV, whereby no changes at all occur during the menstrual cycle [e.g. ].
Precisely because of the dynamics of the vaginal econiche
[e.g. ], studies of the status of the VMC should be lon- gitudinal, spanning at least one menstrual cycle and thereby documenting as much as possible disturbing events such as menses, sexual intercourse and usage of antibiotics. Indeed, although women may retain the lactobacillar microflora during menses [e.g. ], most (longitudinal) studies confirm the established knowledge that menses are wreaking havoc among the lactobacilli present and that lactobacilli numbers wane with glycogen levels (also lowest during and just after menses) . Interestingly, several studies showed that L. crispatus was frequently overgrown by L. iners during events



of disturbance (menses, coitus) . Moreover, only lon- gitudinal studies may determine to what extent physiological (i.e. spontaneously transient) and pathogenic (i.e. persistent and transmittable) dysbioses differ microbiologically.
With regard to the question of how lactobacilli manage to monopolize the vaginal econiche, much controversy remains. It is now well-established that lactobacilli numbers increase with glycogen levels and that pH decreases with rising numbers of lactobacilli . Thus far, consensus exists.
With regard to the question of whether lactobacilli can metabolize glycogen directly or depend on prior degradation by host alpha-amylase to maltose (-oligomers) remains un- clear. In the case of prior degradation, this would explain how glucose monomers become available in the vagina, but not how this would benefit Lactobacillus growth, as all other in- habitants could use it as well. With regard to the ability of lactobacilli to directly metabolize glycogen, controversial findings are reviewed in this issue .
As lactic acid is produced by different taxa of bacteria, although possibly not as efficient as homofermentative lactic acid producers such as many lactic acid bacteria (which include lactobacilli and streptococci), the question remains as to why low vaginal pH is not achieved in case of non-Lacto- bacillus-dominated VMCs. One obvious answer would be that, for these non-Lactobacillus VMCs, acid production is neutralized by proteolytic activity, resulting in alkalinizing amine production, but lactobacilli may be strongly proteolytic as well. Also, in case low pH due to lactic acid production is the major strategy of lactobacilli for monopolizing the vaginal econiche, as strongly advocated by Tachedjian et al. in this issue , it remains puzzling as to why other proficient lactic acid producers that are resistant to acidic conditions, such as streptococci (including Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS)), do not overgrow more frequently.
With regard to hydrogen peroxide production as a strategy for inhibiting growth of other bacteria, strong arguments have been raised against it on the basis of solid experimental findings and taking into consideration that oxygen is needed to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), whereas the vagina is characterized by a low level of oxygen and a high level of carbon dioxide . Still, the association between H2O2- producing lactobacilli and their ability to protect against STI and APO is so strong that H2O2 production is probably more than a mere biomarker of species that dominate for other reasons. Still, the way H2O2 is produced and the manner in which lactobacilli protect themselves against this reactive oxygen species and, as such, become aerotolerant anaerobes is still unclear. It has been argued convincingly that lactobacilli are not very vulnerable for H2O2 because their metabolism is not iron-dependent (an exceptional achievement among all living organisms), thus enabling them to escape the devas- tating consequences of the Fenton reaction , but this seems to be contradicted by the presence of an iron transport system, unique to L. crispatus . The recent publication of Hertz- berger et al. might shed some light, explaining how H2O2 production is constitutive and how it even reduces overall oxygen stress .

In summary, although the issue of the relationship between glycogen, lactobacilli and lactic acid production seems to be settled, much controversy remains regarding the exact glycogen metabolism and the roles of lactic acid and H2O2 in the colonization resistance offered by vaginal lactobacilli.
Probiotics, defined as live organisms that confer a health benefit when administered in adequate amounts , may play a role in the equilibration of an altered vaginal microbiome or dysbiosis, an idea that, according to our knowledge, was already put forward almost a century ago . Microbiome restoration may be important in the prevention or treatment of recurrent diseases linked to dysbiosis, such as BV and aerobic vaginitis (AV). Candidate probiotics should be selected on the basis of predefined criteria, including their ability to recolo- nize the vaginal mucosa and to kill or displace pathogens by releasing antimicrobial factors and/or acidifying the vagina . An interesting property of lactobacilli, making them very suitable as probiotics, is their capacity to produce lactic acid. The antimicrobial, antiviral and immunomodulatory properties of lactic acid are reviewed by Tachedjian et al. .

Vaginal dysbiosis

Vaginal dysbiosis is caused by an imbalance in the composition of the vaginal microbiota, and is characterized by a shift in microbiome constituents, with an overall decrease in lactobacilli, except for L. iners .
The most common anaerobic polybacterial dysbiosis has been associated with the clinical syndrome termed bacterial vaginosis .
For decades, Gardnerella vaginalis was suggested to be the causative agent of BV, despite the controversy concerning its role in BV, which arose soon after its discovery, because G. vaginalis could also be cultured from vaginal secretions of women without symptoms of BV, and even from women with a low Nugent score upon Gram staining of the vaginal spec- imen slide. The pathogenic role of G. vaginalis, as had been argued by Herman Gardner, 1955 from the start, and as exemplified by his coining of the designation 'Haemophilus vaginalis vaginitis' for BV, has been strengthened by studies showing that this species is more virulent than all other vaginal species, e.g. with regard to its adherence to vaginal cells and its ability to produce biofilm . Acceptance of a pathogenic role for G. vaginalis, would, however, reinforce the paradox that this species is also present as a commensal. Possible so- lutions to this paradox may come from the increasing aware- ness that, first, we may be dealing with different genotypes, even three to four different species, within G. vaginalis e, with different virulence characteristics , and second, from the realization that there may be different con- ditions for BV. In order to elucidate the role played by G. vaginalis in BV and to distinguish pathogenic from commensal strains, attempts to relate specific biotypes or ge- notypes  to clinical  symptoms  were  undertaken. Four distinct
G. vaginalis subgroups have been identified . The different types may be associated with different pathogenicities and the production of G. vaginalis specific virulence factors such as



vaginolysin and sialidase, which may vary among G. vaginalis types . Schellenberg et al., in this issue, offer new insight into the diversity of G. vaginalis and its physiological interaction with other microorganisms, and they suggest that
G. vaginalis may actually comprise four separate species. Possibly, some of these species are more commensal, while others are more closely related to, or even causative for, BV. In addition to BV, dominated by strictly anaerobic organ- isms for which oxygen is highly toxic, other dysbiotic states have been recognized, with a predominance of facultative anaerobic enteric pathobionts such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, both of which grow equally well in aerobic conditions, and group B Streptococcus (S. agalactiae). A clinical syndrome caused by this imbalanced state of the microbiome was recognized in 2002 and has been named aerobic vaginitis (AV) . AV is identified by purulent discharge, vaginal inflammation and deficient epithelial maturation. Desquamative inflammatory vaginitis (DIV) is a more severe type of AV; it is a chronic condition with vaginal rash and purulent discharge . Contrary to BV, the discharge is not marked by the fishy smell but by a foul- smelling rotten odor. At present, AV is not well known and not widely accepted as a separate clinical entity among cli- nicians and researchers. Epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, sequels and impact on pregnancy outcome remain to be elucidated, among many other items. In this issue, Donders et al. point out that metronidazole is not effective against the pathogens involved in AV and is not effective in reducing preterm birth in cases of vaginal dysbiosis (comprising both BV and AV). They stress that four randomized controlled studies have shown a substantial reduction in the occurrence of preterm birth in women with AV treated with clindamycin e although two other studies could not show improved outcome, indicating that treatment of vaginal dysbiosis with clindamy-
cin may be preferable, since it covers both AV and BV.
Although several attempts were made , the HTS-based studies have contributed little to distinguishing different states of dysbiosis, although it is clear that there must exist many differences between them. Indeed, vaginal dysbiosis may be a physiological, transient state, spontaneously resolving, that occurs, for example, after intercourse and may be sexu- ally enhanced, or it may be more permanent/recurrent and, moreover, sexually transmittable , by means of biofilm fragments, as has been suggested . Also, differentiation between BV and AV, which may be essential for better un- derstanding the impact of these different dysbioses on, e.g. APO , has not been clarified by HTS studies.
Indeed, vaginal dysbiosis, be it BV, AV or DIV, may have a major impact on women's health and that of the unborn child. It has been associated with the acquisition and transmission of STIs, including HIV, pelvic inflammatory disease, negative reproductive health and pregnancy outcome and maternal and neonatal infections. In addition to the impact of vaginal dys- biosis on the health of women and neonates at the individual level, the global burden of vaginal dysbiosis is high, as assessed by van de Wijgert and Jespers in this issue . They recommend setting up sufficiently powered epidemiological

studies, ideally prospective in nature, and applying molecular methods in order to address the etiology and pathogenesis of vaginal dysbiosis, especially in the regions and populations most affected, i.e. among women in resource-poor settings, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.

Vaginal biofilm

The era in which bacteria have been considered only as unicellular organisms, living and surviving through their sol- itary planktonic lifestyle, is gradually coming to an end with the discovery of the bacterial multicellular lifestyle and bio- film formation. Depending on environmental conditions, bac- teria, especially those that possess pili and flagella or exhibit chemotaxis, may exhibit two forms of lifestyle: planktonic or biofilm .
Biofilms are structured microbial communities embedded in a polymeric extracellular matrix . The structure protects the bacteria against hostile external factors, including antibi- otics and phagocytes and acts as a reservoir in which bacteria can persist for longer periods and re-emerge when conditions are more favorable . Biofilms are formed on biotic or biological surfaces, but also on abiotic or synthetic areas.
Current insights into biofilms formed on vaginal epithelial cells associated with vaginal dysbiosis, as well as biofilms developing on indwelling vaginal devices such as intrauterine devices and intravaginal rings, are presented in this issue by Hardy et al. , who point out that future research should investigate whether biofilm formation might  hamper release of an active product in case of drug-releasing devices such as vaginal rings, or promote the presence of unfavorable bac- teria in the vagina. Biofilms might well provide an explana- tion for recurrence under conditions such as BV or Candida vaginitis.

The ambiguous roles of L. iners and Mollicutes

The emergence of non-culture-based molecular methods has expanded our knowledge of the vaginal microbiota: un- cultivable, unknown microorganisms have been detected; and fastidious organisms such as Atopobium vaginae and L. iners have been detected more frequently due to the improved sensitivity of molecular amplification techniques .
It has become clear that the vaginal microbiome contains a multitude of organisms, among which some are frequently detected, but neglected with regard to the role they may play in both eubiotic and dysbiotic vaginal microbiota. L. iners is one of these bacteria deserving closer scrutiny. It has been over- looked because it does not grow on De Man Rogosa Sharpe agar (MRS), a medium selective for lactobacilli. Numerous other characteristics, including the production of inerolysin, a cholesterol-dependent cytotoxin with high similarity to vagi- nolysin, produced by G. vaginalis, render this a highly unusual Lactobacillus, which is, moreover, frequently present under conditions of vaginal dysbiosis. One contribution by Vanee- choutte deals specifically with this species .



Mollicutes too are worth a closer examination. In- vestigations of their role in vaginal dysbiosis and genital tract infections and their impact on reproductive health have recently become more feasible thanks to the availability of molecular research tools.
Mollicutes are characterized by their small size and genomes, and their absence of cell walls. Up until now, not much is known about the role they may play in dysbiotic vaginal conditions. Many questions related to their capacity for colonization, pathogenicity and involvement with preterm birth remain unanswered and call for more research, although there is increasing evidence that Mycoplasma hominis contributes to the symptoms of BV . M. hominis is frequently detected in women, and its concentration increases in case of vaginal dys- biosis. A symbiotic mechanism in which M. hominis benefits from the dysbiotic vaginal microbiome has been hypothesized . Another species, Mycoplasma genitalium, after years of debate, has recently been recognized as being a sexually transmitted pathogen causing non-gonococcal urethritis in men . The evidence that the same organism could cause vaginitis in women remains inconclusive. Equally uncertain is the role played by ureaplasma, Ureaplasma urealyticum or Ureaplasma parvum, in spontaneous preterm labor and preterm birth.
In this issue, TayloreRobinson revisits the four most important Mollicutes in vaginal microbiology: M. genitalium,
M. hominis, U. parvum and U. urealyticum .
M. hominis and a newly identified Mollicutes species, Candidatus Mycoplasma girerdii, is addressed in the contri- bution dealing with T. vaginalis, this issue . Both Molli- cutes infect T. vaginalis and affect its virulence.

Vaginal pathobionts

Children acquire vaginal and intestinal microbes from their mothers during natural delivery. Besides health-promoting bacteria, pathogens may also be acquired in utero or during passage through the birth canal. The most common and clin- ically important pathobionts found in the vaginal microbiome are E. coli and group B Streptococcus (GBS), the roles of which, in invasive maternal and neonatal infections, have been well-documented .
On a global scale, GBS remains the leading cause of sepsis and meningitis in infants in the first 90 days of life . Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for women colonized with GBS, to prevent early-onset sepsis in the neonate. Unfortunately, the treatment is less efficacious in preventing cases of late-onset sepsis that are acquired in the hospital or community and, less frequently, through vertical transmission. An alternative, more effective strategy for reducing the burden of GBS infection might lie in vaccination of pregnant women. The vaccine would protect newborns and young infants through transplacental antibody transfer, and potentially by reducing new vaginal colonization . In this issue, the role of GBS in neonatal sepsis and stillbirth is reviewed by Cools and Melin .
While GBS is the leading cause of early-onset sepsis, E. coli is responsible for the major part of newborn mortality

. This usually harmless commensal of the intestinal tract has been associated with male and female infertility, as well as with a series of adverse pregnancy and perinatal outcomes . E. coli causes vaginal inflammation in a minority of women; this may be explained by the possible existence of commensal and virulent E. coli strains or pathotypes, including pathotypes associated with adverse pregnancy and perinatal outcome. E. coli vaginal infection is addressed in this issue by Cools .

Vaginal fungi

Very little is known about the fungal species present in the vaginal ecosystem. However, using culture and molecular techniques, fungi have been found to be highly prevalent in the vaginal microbiome .
Candida albicans is predominantly present and is consid- ered to be a commensal member of the vaginal microbiome. C. albicans is one of the few Candida species capable of forming hyphae, which are associated with the vaginal infection known as vulvovaginal candidiasis. However, what exactly triggers transition of the commensal C. albicans to the pathogenic form remains unknown. On the other hand, it has been hypothesized that the vaginal lactobacilli, through their production of short fatty acids and lactate, may inhibit the yeast-to-hyphae tran- sition . In addition, it has been demonstrated in vitro that, in the presence of lactic acid, C. albicans can alter immune responses by increasing IL-10 and decreasing IL-17 production and can thus escape the host immune response . The reduction in IL-17 production associated with vulvovaginal candidiasis was recently confirmed . Furthermore, C. albicans is also able to produce extracellular hydrolytic en- zymes and heat shock proteins and to form biofilm.
In this issue, Cauchie et al. shed some light on the dual lifestyle of C. albicans and its interaction with the vaginal microbiota .

T. vaginalis and its symbionts

Interactions between microorganisms can alter their viru- lence and pathogenicity, as illustrated in the contribution on biofilm. Additional cooperation mechanisms exist and are highlighted in the review by Fichorova et al. , who address the symbiosis of different classes of organisms, i.e. Mollicutes and double-stranded RNA viruses, with T. vaginalis, a proto- zoic parasite of the female genital tract. It was already known that M. hominis can infect T. vaginalis, but recently, a separate Mollicutes species living in symbiosis with T. vaginalis was identified and named Candidatus M. girerdii . Also, intracellular viruses were detected in T. vaginalis and, at present, a total of four double-stranded RNA viruses have been identified .
Symbionts modify T. vaginalis cells by upregulating viru- lence genes and increasing the growth rate. They increase adherence of T. vaginalis and decrease adherence of lactoba- cilli to vaginal epithelial cells, while favoring adherence of BV-associated bacteria.



Conclusion

The microbiome is a recently identified human organ which calls for increased active and intensive research . Organs are defined as structures composed of cells performing specific functions or cooperating in activity; alterations in cell composition or structures may impact these functions and damage health. Microbiota in humans are composed of mi- croorganisms contributing to human health. Dysbiosis of the microbiome may cause or facilitate disease. This is also true for the vaginal microbiome, which influences the vaginal health of women, but also the immediate and long-term health of their progeny. However, our current knowledge of the constituents and microbe mechanisms and interactions pro- moting health in the vaginal econiche is limited.
With regard to vaginal eubiosis, research during the last two decades has confirmed and somewhat refined basic observa- tions dating back at least one century: the 'healthy' VMC is dominated by one or several species of lactobacilli, and their dominance is strongly linked to the presence of glycogen in the vaginal epithelium, resulting in acidic vaginal pH. It has also become evident that this situation is very specific to our species, while we have no final explanation as to why this should be the case. Still, it is rather amazing that, despite extended research efforts and genome and metagenome char- acterizations, the exact mechanism by which lactobacilli produce lactic acid from glycogen and the mechanism by which they manage to monopolize the vaginal econiche remain matters of debate.
Even with our profound lack of understanding of the pre- dominance of lactobacilli, important insights with regard to vaginal microbiology are beginning to emerge.
First, one Lactobacillus species, i.e. L. iners, deserves further attention because of its unusual characteristics, such as the production of a cytotoxin and because it has even been linked to an increased incidence of preterm birth , a pos- sibility not in contradiction to previous findings . Thus, not all vaginal lactobacilli may be equally benign, and one may even play a pathogenic role.
Also, the long-lasting debate regarding the pathogenic role of G. vaginalis in vaginal dysbiosis may reach a solution, possibly found somewhere in between. First, the observation that BV is characterized by the presence of clue cells, i.e. desquamated vaginal epithelium cells covered with layers of bacterial cells, has been explained by the e in hindsight, obvious e existence of a vaginal polymicrobial biofilm that is predominantly composed of G. vaginalis . This might be the explanation for both the frequent recurrence of BV (chronic BV) coincident with the inability of antibiotics to eradicate BV in a definite manner, and for the possibility that BV, besides being sexually enhanced, is also a sexually transmitted condition .
Indeed, although it is now clear that BV is a pathogenic condition linked to biofilm and sexual transmissibility , LeppEURaluoto    has  repeatedly  argued  for  the  existence  of 'physiological BV', a natural state of dysbiosis that can occur

after, e.g. alkalinization, as a result of coitus, and spontane- ously resolves after a disturbance, such as menses or coitus. As such, whether or not G. vaginalis causes pathogenic biofilm- associated BV rather than mere  dysbiosis  may  depend  on the genotype or on the combination of genotypes and condi- tion present , and which may be linked to differences in virulence .
Finally, now that we may be coming to terms with the true nature of BV and the role played by G. vaginalis, it may also be that we have to downplay the importance of BV in APO. As argued elsewhere in this issue , we may have been over- emphasizing the importance of BV because of our failure to recognize other conditions which may be of a more inflam- matory nature and are therefore better candidates for explaining PTB.
Indeed, whereas it is generally agreed that Candida vagi- nitis, Trichomonas vaginitis and BV are the predominant modes of vaginal dysbiosis, we may have overlooked condi- tions such as aerobic vaginitis (AV), with staphylococci, streptococci and Enterobacteriaceae as characteristic species, and 'partial BV', a dysbiosis presenting a mixture of both BV and AV conditions . Data presented by Donders et al. seem to indicate that 'partial BV' predisposes to APO . If this is true, it might explain the paradoxical finding of different meta- analyses [cited by Donders et al. in ] that prophylactic treatment of BV during pregnancy had no effect on reducing the rate of PTB. However, the rate of PTB was reduced when women were treated early in pregnancy with broader spectrum antibiotics such as clindamycin or metronidazole in combi- nation with erythromycin.
In the case of AV, E. coli and S. agalactiae may be important components, and their clearly pathogenic role is addressed in this special issue by Cools  and Cools and Melin , emphasizing the high neonatal mortality caused by these species.
At present, vaginal infections and diseases are treated and prevented using antibiotics, which are unfortunately restricted to a handful of efficacious antibiotic families. Especially in an era of increasing reports of multiresistant microorganisms, we need to make more effort in the search for microbiome restoration and stabilization approaches, adequate prevention options and alternative antibiotic-free treatments.
Women deserve to be equipped with tools to take care of their vaginal microbiome for the sake of their own and their children's health. Therefore, the increasing number of studies focusing on interactions of microbes with each other and with the host are welcome. Understanding the signals of dysbiosis and infection may lead to the development of products or in- terventions to counteract them.
All in all, it can be concluded that there is clearly some interesting work to be done, and we hope that this special issue of Research in Microbiology will contribute to focusing our efforts in the right direction, further resolving the many par- adoxes of vaginal microbiology and, as such, improving di- agnostics, reducing the burden of BV for individual women and reducing the number of adverse pregnancy outcomes.
