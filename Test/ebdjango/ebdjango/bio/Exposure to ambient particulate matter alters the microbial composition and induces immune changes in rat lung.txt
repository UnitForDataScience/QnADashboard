Background
Particulate matter (PM) refers to an air-suspended mix- ture of pollutants, which contains a complex mixture of smoke, dust, and other solid and liquid materials, as well as numerous biological components. Inhaled  ambient PM represents important environmental exposures that have been linked to death and disease [  Emerging epidemiological evidence also suggests that these expo- sures increase the risks of respiratory diseases - Research on PM has mostly focused on the lung inflam- matory response to inhalation, as this is considered the primary impact of PM exposure -]. Recent studies

have linked changes in the lung microbiome to human disease, but the effects of PM on the  lung microbiome are largely unknown ].
Research using culture-independent, sequence-based techniques such as 16S ribosomal RNA microarrays has shown that the lungs are not sterile   There is a growing understanding that the lung microbiome plays a critical role in health and disease  In addition, the lung microbiome community structure may not only reflect the presence of disease but also  be  associated  with disease features and severity [], adding to the com- plexity of characterizing polymicrobial-host interactions in

 		the lung and their potential mechanistic relationship to

intestine [, ]. In spite of the increasing attention paid to the gut microbiome in PM exposures, few studies have attempted to elucidate the role of the lung microbiome in response to inhaled PM. In this study, we hypothesized that exposure to ambient PM may alter the microbial composition and induce immune changes in the lung.

Methods
Animals
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (7-9 weeks in age) were ob- tained from Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine (Guangzhou, China). The experimental protocol and animal care complied with the guiding principles for the care and use of laboratory animals recommended by the Chinese Association for Laboratory Animal Science Policy. A total of 57 rats were randomly divided  into three groups (control, biomass fuel [BMF], and motor vehicle exhaust [MVE]; n = 19 per  group).  All  rats were kept in a specific pathogen-free room and were housed two to a cage. The animal facility maintained temperature control and a 12-h light/dark cycle. Rats were given standardized food and  water  ad  libitum, and were  allowed  to  adjust  to  their  environment  for at least 7 days before the experiments.


PM exposure system
Rats were exposed to PM as described previously  The control group was exposed to clean air every day    for 4 weeks. PM mass concentrations and particle size distributions were monitored in real time during the exposure by a DustTrak II aerosol monitor 8530 (TSI, Shoreview, MN, USA). At the same time, gas concentra- tions (O2, carbon monoxide [CO], nitrogen oxides  [NOX], and sulfur dioxide [SO2]) in the exposure rooms were monitored by a Testo 340 portable flue gas analyzer (Testo, Lenzkirch, Germany).
Exposure to BMF: The rats in the BMF group were ex- posed to smoke produced by smoldering China fir sawdust (30 g/exposure)  for four 1-h periods, 5 days per week, for   4 weeks. The BMF was generated by a burn stove (500 w) for 10 min and the smoke was sent into the animal exposure room through a piston pump (5 L/min).
Exposure to MVE: A Wuyang model WY48QT-2, 1.6- Kw, 125-cm3, one-cylinder, four-cycle, gasoline-powered motorcycle (Guangzhou, China) was used as the MVE source. The motorcycle was operated using premium low- sulfur gasoline (<150 ppm; Petro Inc., El Paso, TX, USA) and 5 W-50 motor oil (ExxonMobil, Irving, TX, USA). The motorcycle engine was operated in an idle state for  2 min and then stopped for 10 min to achieve a stable mass con- centration. The rats in the MVE group were exposed to PM for two 2-h exposure periods, 5 days per week, for 4 weeks.


Sample preparation and isolation of alveolar macrophages (AMs)
Rats were sacrificed after the 4-week exposure  period (day 29) using pentobarbitone (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) administered by intra-peritoneal injection according to body weight (90 mg/kg). The lungs were cyclically inflated and deflated with 6 mL of phosphate- buffered saline (PBS) (Gibco-Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). This was repeated for a total lavage fluid volume of 18 mL. For microbiome analysis, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was centrifuged at 15,000 g for 30 min at 4 degC. The supernatants were discarded and the pellets were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 degC. The remainder BALF was processed as described below.
BALF was centrifuged at 200 g for 5 min at 4 degC to obtain the cells and supernatants. The supernatant was frozen at -80 degC for biochemical analyses, and the cell pellet was rinsed and suspended in RPMI-1640 complete medium (Gibco-Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco-Thermo Fisher Scientific)  and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco-Thermo Fisher Scientific). AMs were plated and incubated for 2 h at 37 degC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Nonadherent cells were removed by gentle rinsing with complete medium.

Differential BALF count
For Diff-Quik cell staining (Baso Diagnostics, Inc., Zhuhai, China), a portion of each sample was diluted to   2 x 104 cells per 100 mL and fixed by cytospin (Shandon Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Differential cell counts were assessed based on 400 cells counted from each slide.

Phagocytosis assay and confocal microscopy
Phagocytosis was measured as described previously ,  Staphylococcus aureus 1.2386 and Streptococcus pneumo- niae 1.8722 were obtained from the China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center (Beijing, China) and fluorescently labeled using Alexa Fluor 488 dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Fluorescently-labelled polystyrene beads (2-mM diameter) were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific.
For the in vitro assay, AMs were plated onto 24-well plates (5 x 104 cells/well; Corning, Corning, NY, USA) and incubated with S. aureus and S. pneumoniae at a ratio of 100 bacteria per  cell for 2 h (fluorescent beads  at a ratio of 50 beads per cell for 4 h) at 37 degC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. After incubation, cells were rinsed with Dulbecco's PBS  (D-PBS),  and the fluorescence of extracellular bacteria was quenched by adding trypan blue (2%, v/v) for 1 min. AMs were rinsed again with D-PBS, trypsinized by trypsin (Gibco-Thermo Fisher Scientific), and resuspended in ice-cold PBS. A total of 10,000 cells were measured and analyzed using a BD





















Accuri(r)  C6  flow  cytometer  (Becton  Dickinson,  Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Data were expressed as median fluorescence intensity (MFI).
Confocal microscopy was used to ascertain whether the beads were internalized as described previously []. Cells were viewed on a confocal microscope with a krypton- argon laser fluorescence detector (Zeiss LSM880, Oberkochen, Germany).

Immunoglobulin assays
Immunoglobulin concentrations were measured in col- lected supernatants using commercial ELISA kits (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Proteins measured included total IgA, IgG, and IgM. Briefly, each kit was a solid-phase sandwich ELISA utilizing monoclonal antibodies specific for the target protein. All procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoglobulin con- centrations were expressed as mg/mL of supernatant.

16S rRNA gene sequence analysis
Illumina sequencing was performed on amplicons from cDNA extracted from BALF samples of six BMF- exposed, six MVE-exposed, and six air-exposed rats. The total DNA from a 200-mL aliquot of the supernatant was extracted with the Qiagen DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument (San Diego, CA, USA) using the 300 paired-end protocol at the Ribobo Genome Center (Guangzhou, China) as described previously ].
Sequence reads were processed to remove low-quality reads. Unique reads were pre-clustered by Mothur soft- ware scripts []. Unique reads from each sample were clustered into a group of similar sequences, each represen- tative of a 16 s rRNA sequence from a bacterial genus or species, and termed operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Next, OTU numbers were calculated using Mothur scripts

based on 97% similarity. Unique reads were aligned to the Ribosome Database Project database [] and annotated. OTUs were then classified to one species if more than 51% contained unique reads annotated to this species. QIIME software scripts (version 1.50) were used to analyze the distribution of all annotated species or OTUs in different taxonomic levels (phylum, class, order, family, genus) among different samples. Community (alpha) di- versity indices combine species richness and abundance into a single value of evenness. As the most widely used indices, taxonomic alpha diversity was measured using OTU, Chao 1 indices, phylogenetic diversity whole tree (PD_whole_tree), and observed_species -].

Lung morphometric analysis
Lung tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solu- tion and embedded in paraffin  using  standard  methods as described previously  Sections (5-mm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to detect cellular infiltration. For each animal, 10 fields were captured at a x 200 magnification in a blinded fashion

Values are shown as mean +- SEM. CON, control group; BMF, biomass fuel exposure group; MVE, motor vehicle exhaust exposure group; PM, particulate matter



















using an image analyzer platform (Leica, Germany). Alveolar enlargement and destruction were quantified by the mean linear intercept (Lm), and the bronchial wall thickness was calculated as wall thickness = (total bron- chial area - lumen area)/total bronchial area.

Statistical analysis
Data are reported as mean +- standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analysis was performed in SPSS version 21 (IBM SPSS 21, Armonk, NY, USA) using Stu- dent's t-test for normally distributed populations and the Mann-Whitney U-test for populations where normal

distribution was not accomplished. A p-value  of  less than 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
Particle size distributions in suspension and gas concentrations in the exposure rooms during air pollution PM exposure
PM mass concentrations and particle size distributions were measured during the PM exposures. The variations in both the BMF exposure room and the MVE exposure room are depicted in Fig. We also measured gas con- centrations inside the chambers, to estimate levels of







gaseous co-pollutants generated by combustion. The mean +- SEM concentrations of various particle sizes (PM10, PM2.5, and PM1) and gases (O2, CO,  NOx,and SO2) in the exposure rooms are shown in Table 


Phagocytosis by AMs following PM exposure
There were no significant differences in total BALF cell counts between the PM exposure group and control group, but the BALF macrophage  counts  increased  in the BMF group compared   with   the   control   group  (p = 0.045) (Fig. 
The phagocytic response of AMs to fluorescently labeled bacteria or beads was determined by flow cytometry. AMs from the three groups exhibited dif- ferential capacities to phagocytose bacteria. Increased phagocytosis of S. aureus and S. pneumoniae was ob- served in the MVE exposure  group,  compared  with the control group (p < 0.01). AMs from the BMF- exposed group exhibited an increased  capacity  to ingest S. aureus (p = 0.012), but did not  differ  from AMs derived from control rats in their capacity  to  ingest S. pneumoniae (p = 0.097) (Fig. ).  However,  there was no difference in phagocytosis of beads between the three groups (Fig. .


PM exposure induces immunoglobulin changes Concentrations of total IgA, IgG, and IgM were mea- sured using ELISA kits. IgA levels in BALF increased following the 4-week exposure to BMF (p < 0.01) and MVE (p = 0.02) compared with air exposure (Fig. In contrast, IgG levels decreased significantly in the BMF group compared with controls (p = 0.031). A downward trend that was not statistically significant  was  seen  in the MVE group (Fig.  BALF from all groups contained similar concentrations of IgM (Fig.  Im- munoglobulin concentrations were expressed  as  mg/mL of the BALF supernatant.

Effects of PM exposure on lung morphology
Figure (, shows that the Lm values in the lungs of rats exposed to BMF and MVE for 4 weeks did not differ from those of rats exposed to clean air. Moreover, the thickness of bronchial walls in the  lungs of rats exposed to BMF and MVE particles was similar to that of control rats (Fig. ,  suggesting that the exposures did not induce morphological changes.

Changes in lung bacterial diversity following PM exposure
A total of 1,484,863 raw reads were generated for all

 		samples, with an average of 82,492 total reads per
sample. After filtering for low-quality reads, 1,205,883 sequence reads were used for subsequent analyses and resulted in 31,701 OTUs (Table Comparison between the three groups showed that bacterial abundance (OTU number) increased significantly in the BMF group and MVE group compared with the control group (p = 0.021 and p < 0.01, respectively). The mean (SEM) OTU num- bers for the control, BMF, and MVE groups were 1227.8 (78.6), 1651.8 (162.8) and 2403.8 (221.9), respectively (Fig. ). The MVE group exhibited higher bacterial diversity than the BMF and control groups; the BMF group exhibited higher bacterial diversity than the control group (Fig. -

Lung bacterial composition
To determine the response of the host microbiome  to  PM, we analyzed the taxonomical community  structure of the microbiome in BALF samples of air-exposed, BMF-exposed, and MVE-exposed rats. At the phylum level, all samples from control, BMF, and MVE groups contained four major bacterial phyla (%): Proteobacteria, 75.5 +- 1.5, 67.5 +- 8.1, and 62.6 +- 4.5, respectively; Firmi-
cutes, 5.4 +- 0.9, 12.3 +- 5.6, and 11.4 +- 2.1, respectively;
Bacteroidetes; 3.3 +- 0.4, 6.1 +- 2.7, and 3.7 +- 0.8, respect-
ively; Actinobacteria, 11.7 +- 1.8, 8.3 +- 3.9, and 7.0 +- 1.1 respectively. The first three phyla accounted for  over  80% of the total sequences in all three groups (Fig. 



















Relative abundances of bacterial phyla differed (p < 0.05) between the control and MVE groups. On the basis of Bonferroni post hoc testing, expansion of the Proteo- bacteria phylum was the most significant driver of the difference between the control group and the MVE group (75.5 +- 1.5 vs. 62.6 +- 4.5, p = 0.017). There was  no significant difference between  the control  group  and BMF group.
At the family level, on the basis of these assignments, the sequences represented in the four phyla were distrib- uted into 67 bacterial families. Twelve bacterial families differed in their relative abundance in samples from the three groups (Fig.  Clostridiaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Hyphomonadaceae, and Veillonellaceae were present in higher proportions in the BMF group than in the control group (Fig.  Clostridiaceae, Brocadiaceae, Hyphomo- nadaceae, Planococcaceae, Hyphomicrobiaceae, and Veillonellaceae were present in higher proportions in the MVE group, whereas Aerococcaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Comamonadaceae, Oxalobacteraceae, and Caulobactera- ceae were present in lower proportions than in the control group (Fig. ). A comparison of the BMF and MVE groups showed a higher prevalence of Clostridiaceae,

Hyphomonadaceae, Brocadiaceae, Veillonellaceae, and Mycobacteriaceae in the BMF group, while Pseudomona- daceae were more prevalent in the MVE group (Fig. ).

Discussion
Air pollution is a major environmental issue contrib- uting to chronic respiratory diseases; industry, traffic, and household biomass combustion have become major sources of ambient PM emissions Moreover, incomplete combustion of biomass fuel and living in proximity to traffic have been associated with a high prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)   which is why we elected to focus on BMF and MVE in our study. The PM concentrations  of BMF and MVE reported here are in accordance with those in our previous studies, which measured the upper bound of indoor air pollution generated during cooking in rural areas of Southern China [, ], and with those measured in Northern China under heavy haze conditions []. Exposure to ambient particulate matter for 6 months causes airway cells to release multiple cytokines capable of inducing pronounced COPD in rat models [ We therefore selected a short-term exposure to determine

whether PM alters the lung microbial composition be- fore lung morphometric changes  occur.  In  this  study, we demonstrated that a 4-week exposure of rats to airborne PM increased the lung bacterial load and diversity, and altered the microbial composition before


any histopathological changes occurred.  Furthermore, PM exposure increased phagocytosis by AMs and  induced changes in immunoglobulins.
Microdysbiosis is defined as quantitative and qualitative changes in the microbiota, including an increase in com- mon bacterial inhabitants that can become pathogenic under selective pressures []. Previous studies support the hypothesis that inhaled air pollution may impact the microbial composition of the lung [, ]. These studies found that exposure to higher levels of particulates re- sulted in higher abundances of potentially pathogenic bacteria within the lung microbiome. We found that samples from the BMF and MVE groups contained higher bacterial abundances and bacterial diversity than samples from the control group, based on the OTU numbers and alpha diversity, supporting the study of Yu and colleagues, who demonstrated that microbiota taxonomic alpha diver- sity increases with environmental exposures, and that spe- cific aspects of the lung microbiota are related to different sources of PM []. Rylance and colleagues reported that domestic BMF use was associated with an uncommon environmental bacterium (Petrobacter) usually found in oil reservoirs []. We found that the distribution of phyla in the MVE group differed significantly from distribution in the control and BMF groups (Fig. , and that this change was driven by increases in Proteobacteria. At the family level, 12 bacterial families differed in their relative abundance in samples from the three groups (Fig. , not only between the PM exposure groups and the controls, but also within the exposure groups. Clostridiaceae, Hyphomonadaceae, Brocadiaceae, Veillonellaceae, and Mycobacteriaceae were more prevalent in the BMF group,
























whereas Pseudomonadaceae numbers were higher in the MVE group (Fig. ).
We also compared the histopathological  changes  in the lungs of rats exposed to BMF or MVE, but found no significant difference in bronchial wall thickness or alveolar enlargement (Fig.  Combined with our previ- ous findings from a 6-month exposure [ the results indicate that BMF and MVE exposure alters the lung microbiome before lung morphometric changes occur. Moreover, some alterations in bacterial composition were found in the lungs of rats exposed to  BMF  or  MVE, supporting the hypothesis that BMF and MVE exposure can result in various COPD phenotypes [].
Exposure to ambient PM also affects innate and adap- tive immune responses in the rat lung, and this may be partly explained by disordered microbial communities. AMs are known as the principal cells that process


airborne particles in the lung and act as antigen- presenting cells to activate the adaptive immune response []. We found that BALF macrophage counts increased in the BMF group. This is in agreement with previous studies that reported an increase in phagocytic inflamma- tory cell numbers in BALF following exposure to air pollu- tion []. Exposure to PM stimulates the bone marrow, promoting the release of monocytes and their recruit- ment into the lung, where they subsequently differen- tiate into tissue and alveolar macrophages [In our study, AMs from the BMF and MVE exposure groups displayed an increased capacity to phagocytose bac- teria. However, the phagocytic response of these macrophages to polystyrene beads was not altered in cells from the BMF and MVE exposure groups, indi- cating that the change was related specifically to these bacteria. This finding is distinct from that of previous studies [  which reported that PM exposures significantly reduced the uptake of pathogens. How- ever, our results were obtained from in vivo experi- ments, and high-level PM exposures in vitro may not represent biological conditions in an ambient air- polluted environment [ Macrophage phagocytic activity increases with increasing PM  concentrations, but will be impaired when the phagocytic particles exceed 60% of the intracellular  volume,  overloading  the macrophages [
Few data are available on the  effects of ambient PM   on immune functions in the lung.  Some  work  on  PM has centered on alterations in immunoglobulin produc- tion  We found that PM exposure  increased  total IgA levels in BALF samples from both the BMF and MVE exposure groups (Fig. , similarly to the find- ings of Gaschler and colleagues, who reported that an 8-week exposure to cigarette smoke increased IgA







titers in BALF from mice [5]. Interestingly, PM ex- posure in our study decreased total IgG levels in  the BMF group and did not significantly alter  concentra- tions of IgM in the three groups (Fig. b, ). Basilico   and colleagues reported that  total  IgA  and  IgG  levels in mice exposed to cigarette smoke for 6 weeks were similar to or lower than levels in controls Several experimental factors may explain the discordant find- ings: Different exposures (our study did not include cigarettes), the duration and intensity of  the  exposure, and the animal species and strain used. In general, our study and the published literature  show  alterations  in  the adaptive immune response in rodent lungs following a PM exposure.
In summary, we demonstrated that a short-term PM exposure can alter the microbial composition and affect innate and adaptive immune responses in the rat lung. Furthermore, defining the composition of the resident microbiome and how microbial communities shift with exposure may help to explain their role in responding to inhaled particulate matter.

Conclusion
This study found that a short-term PM exposure can alter the microbial composition and induce immune changes in the rat lung.
