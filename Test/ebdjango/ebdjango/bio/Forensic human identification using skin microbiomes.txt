Abstract

The human microbiome contributes significantly to the genetic content of the human

body. Genetic and environmental factors help shape the microbiome, and as such, the

microbiome can be unique to an individual. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential to

use microbiome profiling for forensic applications, however a method has yet to identify stable

features of skin microbiomes that produce high classification accuracies for samples collected

over reasonably long time intervals. A novel approach is described to classify skin microbiomes

to   their   donors   by   comparing   two   features   types,   Propionibacterium   acnes pangenome

presence/absence features and nucleotide diversities of stable clade-specific markers. Supervised

learning was used to attribute skin microbiomes from 14 skin body sites from 12 healthy

individuals sampled at three time points over a >2.5 year period with accuracies up to 100% for

three body sites. Feature selection identified a reduced subset of markers from each body site that

are highly individualizing, identifying 187 markers from 12 clades. Classification accuracies

were compared in a formal model testing framework, and the results of this indicate that learners

trained on nucleotide diversity perform significantly better than those trained on

presence/absence encodings. This study used supervised learning to identify individuals with

high accuracy and associated stable features from skin microbiomes over a period of up to

almost 3 years. These selected features provide a preliminary marker panel for future

development of a robust and reproducible method for skin microbiome profiling for forensic

human identification.

Importance

A novel approach is described to attribute skin microbiomes, collected over a period of

>2.5 years, to their individual hosts with a high degree of accuracy. Nucleotide diversities of

stable clade-specific markers with supervised learning was used to classify skin microbiomes

from a particular individual with up to 100% classification accuracy for three body sites.

Attribute selection was used to identify 187 genetic markers from 12 clades which provide the

greatest differentiation of individual skin microbiomes from 14 skin sites. This study performs

skin microbiome profiling from a supervised learning approach and obtains high classification

accuracy for samples collected from individuals over a relatively long time period for potential

application to forensic human identification.

Introduction

The human microbiome plays a critical role in health, metabolism, and immune response

(1) and can be influenced by numerous factors, including but not limited to genetics, geography,

diet, and hygiene (2)(3)(4). Colonization of the human microbiome begins at birth and continues

to change throughout development (5)(6), contributing an additional 5,000,000 genes from the

gut microbiome alone (7) to the repertoire of human genes. Since unique genetic and

environmental factors help shape the microbiome, the composition of the microbiome has the

potential to be unique to its host individual. Features of the personal microbiome, such as strain-

specific signatures (8)(9), which may be stable over time, make microbiome characterization

potentially applicable to forensic human identification.











Current forensic human profiling methods typically utilize autosomal short tandem

repeats (STRs) profiles to attribute forensic biological evidence to a suspect (or victim) (10).

Often evidentiary samples contain mixtures of human DNA from multiple sources or contain low

amounts (i.e., low-copy number (LCN)) or degraded DNA, making interpretation of mixed or

partial profiles difficult or inconclusive. In these cases alternative methods may be employed,

such as sequencing high-copy number markers (e.g., targeting the hypervariable regions of the

mitochondrial genome (11)(12) or whole mitochondrial genomes (13)), or methods to enhance

sensitivity of detection including concentrating DNA extracts, increasing polymerase chain

reaction (PCR) cycles, or performing whole-genome amplification (14). The human microbiome

is an example of another high-copy number genetic marker, since microbial cells may be at a

ratio of 1:1 (15) to 10:1 to human cells (16), and thus it is a potential target to complement partial

or inconclusive STR profiles to increase resolution for human source attribution.

Recent studies have demonstrated the potential to use microbiome profiling for forensic

identification, mainly using unsupervised methods to show that microbiome samples from

touched objects resemble their respective donors (17)(18)(19). Few studies have addressed

microbiome profiling from a supervised approach, i.e., for the purposes of classification.

Franzosa et al. (8) used a nearest-neighbor classification approach using clade-specific markers

and 1kb genomic windows to identify strain-level metagenomic codes specific to individuals;

however this method could identify only <30% of individuals using skin microbiomes (i.e.,

anterior nares) sampled over a time interval of 30-300 days. Lax et al. (20) and Williams et al.

(21) used random forests trained on operational taxonomic units (OTUs) abundances of targeted

16S rRNA sequences for human identification. While both approaches were highly accurate

(96.3% and 97.3%, respectively), the samples were collected over short time intervals (< 3 days











or just a single time point, respectively) (20) (21), making their results less applicable to a typical

forensics setting.

Individual-specific microbiome features with the greatest temporal stability (up to almost

3 years) include single-nucleotide variant (SNV) profiles of Propionibacterium acnes from the

skin (9) and gene signatures (i.e., clade-specific markers and 1kb genomic windows) from the

gut microbiome (8). Strain-level signatures from shotgun sequencing provide far more depth of

resolution than 16S rRNA based features, such as terminal restriction fragment length

polymorphism profiles (18)(22)(23), OTUs abundances (8)(19)(20) (21) (24)(25), and biological

community distances (e.g., UniFrac distance) (17) (20). Nucleotide diversity of strains, which

measures the strain-level heterogeneity of the microbial population, also has been shown to be

greater between individuals than within the same individual (26). Thus far, features used for

microbiome profiling at the strain-level demonstrate the most success to differentiate individuals

over time. However, a method has yet to be described that identifies differentiating features

stable over reasonably long time intervals and applies appropriate measures on these markers to

perform classification (i.e., via supervised learning) to attribute skin microbiome samples to their

donors.

In this study, a novel approach is described to attribute skin microbiomes to their

individual hosts with a high degree of accuracy and to identify genetic markers which may be

well-suited to individual skin microbiome differentiation. Unsupervised learning techniques were

first evaluated to assess inter- versus intra-sample variation across host microbiomes sampled

across 14 body sites. To assess if microbiomes could be used to be predictive of their host, two

feature types capturing strain-level variation within shotgun metagenomes were compared using

two supervised learning techniques. In particular, Propionibacterium acnes pangenome











presence/absence features and the nucleotide diversities of clade-specific markers were used in

conjunction with regularized multinomial logistic regression (RMLR) and 1-nearest-neighbor

(1NN) classifiers to form predictions on host microbiomes based on samples separated by up to

three years. Feature selection was then used to identify stable features which can be used to

attribute skin microbiomes from multiple body sites to their respective hosts.  This reduced set of

markers was then evaluated to see if they could provide similar predictive power despite using

much less information. The results from our classification algorithms were then formally

compared to evaluate if different body sites and different classification techniques significantly

vary in their predictive capabilities.



Results

Sample and Shotgun metagenomic processing

Publically-available shotgun metagenomic datasets from Oh et al. (9) were used in this

study. Briefly, the Oh et al. (9) dataset consists of an extensive spatial and temporal sampling of

skin microbiomes from 12 healthy individuals across 17 body sites (i.e., antecubital fossa (Ac),

alar crease (Al), back (Ba), cheek (Ch), external auditory canal (Ea), forehead (Fh), hypothenar

palm (Hp), inguinal crease (Ic), interdigital web (Id), manubrium (Mb), occiput (Oc), popliteal

fossa (Pc), plantar heel (Ph), retroauricular crease (Ra), toenail (Tn), and toe web space (Tw),

and volar forearm (Vf)). Skin microbiome samples were collected at three different time points

over a period of almost 3 years, sampled over long (ranging from 10-30 months) and short

(ranging from 5-10 weeks) time intervals (9). In total, 2,446 fastq files from 585 samples,

containing a total of 23 billion reads (mean of 39.3 million reads per sample) were downloaded

from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive (NCBI SRA)











(27). Data were pre-processed to remove sequencing adapters, trim reads with a quality score

less than 20, remove reads less than 50 bp in length, and remove any human host-associated

reads. A total of 12.6 billion quality-controlled reads (mean 21.5 million reads per sample)

remained after read pre-processing. Several samples had substantially lower read depth after read

pre-processing, and only individuals with samples from all three time points at a particular body

site, with >=10x average read depth across all shared markers, were included in the study (n=381;

Table S1). Three body sites from the foot (i.e., plantar heel (Ph), toenail (Tn), and toe web space

(Tw)) also were excluded from the study, as they only shared 2-5 markers among samples.

Taxonomic classification was performed using MetaPhlAn2 (28) to identify the core skin

microbial species shared by all individuals, stable over time (i.e., present at each time point) to

identify likely candidate species which may serve as forensically-relevant targets. The core skin

microbial taxa comprised of all shared species at a particular body site, together included 10

bacterial species (Corynebacterium aurimucosum, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Corynebacterium

pseudogenitalium,	Corynebacterium	tuberculostearicum,	Micrococcus	luteus,

Propionibacterium acnes, Propionibacterium granulosum, Pseudomonas sp., unclassified,

Rothia mucilaginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis), 1 fungal species (Malassezia globosa), and 1

bacteriophage (Propionibacterium phage P101A) (Figure 1). Propionibacterium acnes was the

only species present in all samples at all body sites, ranging in average relative abundance from

35% to 89%, suggesting P. acnes may serve as an informative target species for forensic

applications using skin microbiomes. Indeed, Oh et al. (9) previously reported that P. acnes

strain single-nucleotide variant (SNV) profiles are stable and individual-specific, and the known

P. acnes pangenome (i.e., the composition of all core and accessory genes present from all

known strains of a given species) reaches saturation from all P. acnes strains sampled across











individuals (i.e., all genes from the P. acnes pangenome are present across all samples).

Therefore in this study, the findings of Oh et al. (9) are expanded upon and different features

from P. acnes were evaluated as potential forensic targets in a supervised learning context.



Propionibacterium acnes strain characterization and classification using P. acnes pangenome

presence/absence features

To further assess if P. acnes may serve as a viable taxon for human identification,

maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed over 200 markers specific to the P.

acnes pangenome using RAxML (29). Phylogenies of P. acnes clade-specific markers from each

individual show that P. acnes strains tended to place samples from the same individuals at

different time points within similar positions in the tree, though some exceptions are noted

(Figure 2).

As previously reported, P. acnes strains across all samples reach pangenome gene

saturation (9). Therefore, supervised learning using P. acnes pangenome gene presence/absence

profiles was evaluated as a potential method for attributing skin microbiomes to their respective

donors. P. acnes pangenome presence/absence profiles were constructed by aligning all P. acnes

associated reads to a database comprised of all known genes from 60 P. acnes genomes to

determine the presence or absence of each gene within each sample. Presence/absence feature

vectors, comprised of 551 (ear, Ea) to 1646 (manubrium, Mb) features, were used to perform

classification of host individuals across time points. In particular, regularized multinomial

logistic regression (RMLR) and 1-nearest neighbor (1NN) classification (see Methods) were

used to predict host individuals based on their microbiome signature taken at various time points.

RMLR accuracies ranged from 66.67% at the ear (Ea) and interdigital web (Id) to 95.24% at the











volar forearm (Vf) (4.67- to 9.52-fold higher accuracy than by random chance, respectively) with

a mean accuracy of 79.40% (Table S2). 1NN accuracies ranged from 58.33% at the inguinal

crease (Ic) to 96.30% at the hypothenar palm (Hp) (3.21- to 12.52-fold higher accuracy than by

random chance, respectively) with a mean accuracy of 80.71%. RMLR and 1NN classification

also were evaluated on a reduced set of attribute selected markers (n=9 to 39), with this subset of

markers chosen to have similar predictive power as the sets from which they came (see

Methods). The attribute-selected loci had nearly identical classification accuracies as

classification using all markers collectively (Figure 3).



Feature selection and classification of skin microbiomes using nucleotide diversities of stable

clade-specific markers

The nucleotide diversities of universal, stable clade-specific markers were evaluated as a

novel feature for microbiome profiling of skin microbiomes for forensic applications. Nucleotide

diversity  was  calculated for each clade-specific marker  shared  by all  individuals  and  all  time

points for each body site. The number of clade-specific markers shared by all samples at each

body site ranged from 239 (manubrium, Mb) to 344 (popliteal fossa, Pc) markers. Principal

component analysis (PCA) depicts less variation, of nucleotide diversities of all shared markers,

between samples from the same individuals sampled at different times, than microbiomes from

different individuals (Figure 4). As represented in Figure 4, greater variation (up to 20.85

percentage points more for the cheek, Ch) was explained by the PCA using all shared features,

however marker reduction using feature selection (i.e., correlation-based feature subset selection,

using the CfsSubsetEval evaluator in Weka (30); see Methods), resolves overlapping clusters

from different individuals to produce more defined boundaries around samples from the same











individual, likely due to the reduction of redundant features contributing towards the same level

of variation.

RMLR and 1NN classification were used to classify microbiome samples with respect to

their individual donor in the same manner as the assessment of presence/absence markers.

RMLR accuracies ranged from 66.67% at the inguinal crease (Ic) to 100% at the cheek (Ch)

(3.67- to 10-fold higher accuracy than by random chance, respectively) with a mean accuracy of

87.21% (Table S3). 1NN accuracies ranged from 56.67% at the alar crease (Al) to 100% at the

inguinal crease (Ic) and popliteal fossa (Pc) (8.22- to 7-fold higher accuracy than by random

chance, respectively) with a mean accuracy of 82.20%. RMLR and 1NN classification also were

evaluated on a reduced set of attribute selected markers (n=14 to 47), with this subset of markers

chosen to have similar predictive power as the sets from which they came. The attribute-selected

loci had nearly identical classification accuracies as classification using all markers collectively

(Figure 5).

To assess if our classification methods were robust to differences in time, 1NN

classification accuracies, with and without attribute selection, were compared between the

shortest (sampling collection time points 2 vs. 3 (5-10 weeks)) and longest (sampling collection

time points 1 vs. 3 (>2.5 years)) time intervals at each body site. Microbiome samples collected

5-10 weeks apart could be attributed to their host individual with higher accuracy than

microbiomes samples collected >10-30 months apart (Figure S1). Long time interval accuracies

ranged from 30% at the alar crease (Al) to 100% at the popliteal fossa (Pc) and inguinal crease

(Ic) with a mean accuracy of 69.52% (8.94-fold greater accuracy than by random chance). Short

time interval accuracies ranged from 50% at the ear (Ea) to 100% at the forehead (Fh), inguinal











crease (Ic), popliteal fossa (Pc), and volar forearm (Vf) with a mean accuracy of 85.85% (11.03-

fold greater accuracy than by random chance) (Figure S1).

Feature selection identified 187 clade-specific markers from the following 12 clades that

contributed the most to individual classification across all body sites: family level (n=1) (i.e,

Propionibacteriaceae);	species	level	(n=10)	(i.e.,	Corynebacterium	sp.	HFH0082,

Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum, Propionibacterium acnes,   Propionibacterium  humerusii,

Propionibacterium sp. 434 HC2, Propionibacterium sp. 5 U 42AFAA, Propionibacterium sp.

HGH0353,	Propionibacterium	sp.	KPL1844,	Propionibacterium	sp.	KPL1854,	and

Propionibacterium sp. KPL2008); subspecies level (n=1) (i.e., Propionibacterium namnetense

SK182B-JCVI) (Table S4). These feature selected markers only represent 3 of the 12 core skin

microbiome species (see Figure 1) indicating that both high- and low-abundance taxa contribute

to stable features used for individual differentiation.



Assessing classifier accuracy

Several factors may influence the probability of a correct classification (p) of a given

classifier:  accuracy  varied  substantially  across  body  sites  (BS),  across  feature  vector  type

(diversity or presence/absence) (Type), and feature selection/classifier type (Classifier) may also




impact p. Conditional binomial logistic regression was used to model log ( 

) ~ BS + Type +

1-

Classifier, controlling for intra-individual variation by stratifying on the (host) individual

(Methods). Several of the coefficients (log odds ratios) were statistically significant (Table S5).

In particular, the odds of an accurate classification are estimated to be 28% lower for

presence/absence features than for nucleotide diversity (p<0.01). Mean classification accuracies

(p) were also contrasted between presence/absence and diversity (Figure 6) across classifier











types, and as most points are above the main diagonal (i.e., higher accuracy for diversity over

presence/absence), this provides further evidence that presence/absence features are less

individualizing than nucleotide diversity. RMLR and 1NN, both with and without attribute

selection, did not significantly impact classification accuracy. Classification accuracies did,

however, significantly vary across body sites. Compared to the occiput (Oc) body site (Methods),

which  had  medial  classification  accuracy,  samples  collected  from  the  volar  forearm  (Vf)

(p<0.05),  hypothenar  palm  (Hp)  (p<0.01),  manubrium  (Mb)  (p<0.001),  and  the  check  (Ch)

(p<0.05) had significantly higher odds of being classified correctly, and samples collected from








the ear (Ea) (p<0.001) had significantly lower odds for being classified correctly (Table S5).


B
Discussion


A novel approach is described for the attribution of skin microbiome samples to their

individual donors with a high degree of accuracy. Microbiome samples were collected over a

large timespan (>2.5 years), and yet, classifier accuracies were high across a variety of body sites

(Table S2, Table S3). Of the body sites assessed, those that are likely of the greatest forensic

relevance--the Mb body site (shirt) and the Hp body site (palm)-- yield highly accurate rates of

classification (93%/96%, respectively, using 1NN classification on nucleotide diversity), with

odds ratios of 2.64 and 2.60, respectively, relative to that of a typical body site (occiput (Oc))

(Table S5). This finding is somewhat unexpected for the hand especially as it is likely the target

of frequent recolonization from life's daily tasks and has been shown to contain relatively few

(~17%) shared phylotypes between different hands of the same individual (4). Lax et al. (20)

observed  similar  classification  accuracy  (96.3%)  when  attributing  microbiome  samples from

phone surfaces (i.e., touch samples from the hands and face) to their owners, when sampled  from











one time point for the majority of sample subjects and multiple time points over 2 days for 2

participants. Whereas, when assessing classification accuracy for a skin site (i.e., anterior nares)

over longer time intervals (i.e., 30-300 days), Fransoza et al. (8) was only able to differentiate

<30% of the total number of individuals in the study. The methods reported herein were used to

attribute skin microbiomes to their hosts over long time intervals (> 2.5 years) and obtain high

classification accuracy for multiple skin body sites.

In this study, two different feature types were assessed with supervised learning (i.e.,

RMLR and 1NN) to differentiate skin microbiomes from different individuals. P. acnes

pangenome presence/absence features were selected based on the stability of P. acnes strain-

level signatures and pangenome saturation over time (9) and yielded high classification

accuracies (up to 96.3%), likely due to high species abundance across multiple body sites

allowing for greater genome coverage for characterization. Nucleotide diversity of shared clade-

specific markers was selected as a feature type to capture population-level genetic variation of

stable markers, since nucleotide diversity of strains has been shown to differ significantly

between individuals from different geographical regions (26) . Nucleotide diversity of stable

markers yielded accuracies as high as 100% from the cheek (Ch), inguinal crease (Ic), and

popliteal fossa (Pc) and contributed significantly greater (by an estimated 28%, 95% CI [10%-

43%]) to classification accuracies than presence/absence features (p<0.01) (Table S5). This

finding contrasts those from Fransoza et al. (8) which argued that minimum cardinality sets of

presence/absence features (i.e., 1kb genomic window counts) are an ideal feature type for human

identification. However, we demonstrate that while presence/absence features do provide high

classification accuracies (Table S2), this feature type fails to capture additional genetic variation

which significantly contributes to classification accuracy (i.e., nucleotide diversity) (Table S5).











Furthermore, presence/absence as inferred from shotgun sequencing data are likely susceptible to

stochastic effects, increasing the likelihood that informative markers may drop out in highly

diverse, poorly collected, or degraded samples, sample types typical in forensic settings, and

further requires parameterization on what constitutes "absence".

Attribute selection also was performed to evaluate classification performance using

reduced subsets of features, selected to have similar predictive power as the full set of markers.

Since attribute selection was performed using a correlation-based approach, features were

selected independent of the classifier type (unlike features selected specific to a particular

classifier, e.g., (31)) and thus the markers identified in this study are potentially informative for a

wide range of supervised learning algorithms. Feature selection did not have a significant effect

on classification accuracy (Table S5), indicating that using an average of 24 markers reduced

from 1108 for presence/absence features and an average of 32 markers reduced from 263 clade

specific markers resulted in comparable classification accuracies as using full sets of features.

Feature reduction helps eliminate markers which do not significantly contribute to microbiome

classification (Table S5), thus eliminating potential noise and redundancy in signal, and helps

select for a reduced panel of candidate markers to be developed into a multiplex assay for

targeted sequencing assays for microbiome characterization.

In this study the nucleotide diversities of subsets of clade-specific markers were used to

differentiate skin microbiomes samples from individuals sampled over relatively long time

intervals with a high degree of accuracy. The main limitation within the study herein was sample

size (n=12-30 per body site). In this study, within a given body site only three intra-individual

samples were available, which limits training. Larger sample sizes are needed to further validate

the methods described herein and to develop statistical models to incorporate the likelihood of











microbiome classification to provide weight to similar or inclusionary comparisons. These

results support future development of a robust and reproducible method for human identification

using skin microbiomes. Since microbiomes likely do not have the same level of genetic stability

as the human genome, identifying the most stable, personalizing features within microbiomes

allows for further studies to more comprehensively assess the stability of these features and how

these features contribute to classification accuracy using significantly larger population sample

sets.

The study herein does not address whether the data are applicable to real or mock

forensic applications (e.g., touching an object and recovering deposited skin flora). That study

cannot be performed as public data of this nature are not available. More importantly performing

that study would be premature. Likely for forensic applications informative targets will need to

be enriched, as they are for current human identification methods. Our study has identified

candidate markers that may be suitable to test forensically-relevant samples, such as touched

items which would tend to have low biomass and may be somewhat degraded. Targeted

enrichment and sequencing using a panel of the most informative markers would provide an

ideal solution for microbiome profiling for forensic identification to obtain high coverage at

stable informative sites. A multiplex is being designed to empirically test these selected

candidate markers for classification accuracy and sensitivity at various sites on the human skin,

including the currently low informative foot region. Once assessed for performance, larger data

sets (e.g., population studies) can be generated to enable statistical weighting and resolution

comparisons with those of human identification forensic genetic marker systems. The field of

microbial forensics has expanded from strictly focusing on biothreat attribution to include

multiple areas of microbiome applications (32), and as such, future studies should consider











method development as well as new statistical models to more accurately interpret microbiome

data and establish standards and validation criteria before microbiome profiling can be actively

used for investigative leads and attribution within the forensic scientific community.



Methods

Public skin microbiome dataset selection and download

Skin microbiome shotgun metagenomic datasets, comprised of samples from 12 healthy

individuals across 17 body sites and sampled at different 3 time points, were downloaded using

the NCBI SRA Toolkit (27), using the program fastq-dump to download 2,446 fastq files

(corresponding to 585 samples) from the SRA (27), under bioproject accession PRJNA46333.

Sample collection and sequencing methods are described by Oh et al. (9).



Metagenomic sequence data analysis

Metagenomic datasets were pre-processed for read quality control, using: Cutadapt (33) to

remove  sequence  adapters,  trim  reads  with  quality  scores  <  20,  and  remove  reads  < 50bp;

Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA) (34) to align and remove human host-associated reads;

and Samtools v1.3.1 (35) to convert sorted .bam files to fastq format for downstream use.

Taxonomic classification of skin microbiomes was performed using MetaPhlAn2 (28) using

default parameters. Variant calls and associated coverage for aligned MetaPhlAn2 (28) markers

shared by all samples at a particular body site were determined using Samtools (35) mpileup.

Only samples that met the following criteria for each body site were included in the study: >=50x

maximum coverage at any marker site within samples, >=10x average coverage across all

markers, and samples with all 3 time points for an individual (Table S1). Three body sites from











the foot (i.e., plantar heel (Ph), toenail (Tn), and toe web space (Tw)) also were excluded from

the study, as they only shared 2-5 markers among samples.



A custom perl script was used to parse mpileup outputs and calculate nucleotide diversity (p) of

each marker, with >=5x coverage, shared by all individuals and time points for each body site.

Nucleotide diversity (p) was calculated using the following equation,  = 1 [?] 2 (1 -  ),
      		

where pi is the frequency of the reference base at the ith site in the nth base of the marker, as

described in Nayfach et al. (26). Strain maximum likelihood phylogenies of Propionibacterium

acnes were constructed using RAxML (29) as implemented in StrainPhlAn (36). Briefly,

StrainPhlAn was used to generate sequence alignments using MUSCLE (37), from sequence

reads aligned to 200 P. acnes markers from MetaPhlAn2 (28), and RAxML (29) was used to

generate maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees. The ggtree (38) and ggplot2 (39) R libraries

using the "strainphlan_ggtree.R" script from https://bitbucket.org/biobakery/breadcrumbs was

used to build the trees. Pangenome gene presence/absence profiles for P. acnes were generated

using PanPhlAn (40), using the pre-processed "panphlan_pacnes16" database, download from

https://bitbucket.org/CibioCM/panphlan/wiki/Pangenome%20databases.



Unsupervised Learning, Supervised Learning, and Attribute Selection

Principal component analysis was performed using the prcomp command in R. Statistical

classification was performed in Weka (30). Classification of individuals was performed by

evaluating two data feature types: nucleotide diversity and pangenome gene presence/absence.

Nucleotide diversity and pangenome feature vectors were created using a custom R script, which

also removed any invariant features (defined as having a standard deviation < 1e-6 across all











samples). Regularized multinomial logistic regression (RMLR) and 1-nearest neighbor (1NN)

classification using the Euclidean distance measure were used to perform classification, with all

parameters set to their default values. Classification accuracy (i.e., the percentage of correctly

classified samples in the dataset) was assessed using leave-one-out cross-validation (i.e., n-fold

cross-validation; n=sample size) so as to maximize the size of the training dataset while

mitigating the effects of overfitting. Thus n sets each composed of n-1 individuals were used to

train classifiers, and accuracies were assessed on the single "left out" individual, with the overall

accuracies being the sums of the n correct and incorrect classifications. Attribute selection was

performed by a correlation-based feature subset selection method, using the CfsSubsetEval

evaluator in Weka (30), prior to each classification method, with default parameters and using

leave-one-out cross validation. Upper and lower 95% confidence intervals were calculated for

our estimates of classification accuracies using the binom.confint function from the binom R

library (41) using the "asymptotic" method. All figures were created using the ggplot2 (39) and

cowplot (42) R libraries unless stated otherwise. All custom scripts can be accessed at

https://github.com/SESchmedes/HIDskinmicrobiome.



Conditional binomial logistic regression

Conditional binomial logistic regression was used to evaluate classifier accuracy, which models

the log odds of a correct classification (p) as a linear function of the classifiers employed, the




body site, and the feature vectors evaluated. In particular, log([?]

 1-

) was modeled as a function of

classifier type (1NN and RMLR, both with and without feature selection), the body site (column

1 of Table S1), and feature vector type, i.e., whether the classification was performed using

presence/absence (encoded as 1) or diversity (encoded as 0). As these measures were repeated











within individuals, traditional binomial logistic regression would otherwise underestimate error

terms. Instead conditional binomial logistic regression was used to account for the repeated

measures design, using the host individual as a stratum, with the clogit function in R. For the

body site independent variable we chose the Oc body site as our reference category as it had

medial marginal accuracy (rank 7 of 14), and the largest marginal sample size (n=240).
