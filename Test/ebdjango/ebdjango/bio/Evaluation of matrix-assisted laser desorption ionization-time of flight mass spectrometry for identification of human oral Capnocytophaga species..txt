Abstract

Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-

TOF MS) was evaluated for rapid identification of cfxA PCR positive and negative

Capnocytophaga strains. Colonies were grown on blood agar, incubated anaerobically at

37degC for 48 h, and were then evaluated by MALDI-TOF MS and l6S rRNA gene sequencing.

Both methods identified all colonies to the genus level. The MALDI-TOF MS method gave the

same result, at the species level, as l6S rRNA gene sequencing for 4l/53 Capnocytophaga

sp. strains (77.4%), but the limit of this technique was the absence of some species (C.

leadbetteri, C. AHN) in the Biotyper-Bruker database used in this study. Distinction

between the cefotaxime resistant and susceptible strains was unsuccessful using the MALDI-

TOF MS method. This technique had low discriminatory power to rapidly detect beta-

lactamase-producing Capnocytophaga strains in clinical samples. However, the results from

a score-oriented dendrogram confirmed MALDI-TOF MS is a rapid, inexpensive, and reliable

method for Capnocytophaga species identification. Enrichment of the reference database

used (Biotyper(r)) will improve future results.

50
Capnocytophaga are part of the normal bacterial flora of the oral cavity of humans
51
and animals. Generally, they are considered commensal bacteria but, in immunocompetent
52
or immunocompromised patients, they can be responsible for systemic diseases [l]. These
53
bacteria belong to the family Flavobacteriaceae, order Flavobacteriales, class Flavobacteria,
54
Bacteroidetes  phylum,  and  Bacteria  domain.  This  genus  includes  l0  different  commensal
55
species. There are six isolated from the oral cavity of humans: Capnocytophaga ochracea, C.
56
gingivalis, C. granulosa, C. haemolytica, C. sputigena, C. leadbetteri, and four isolated from
57
the oral cavity of animals: C. canimorsus, C. cynodegmi, C. stomatis, and C. canis. The
58
classification of many described strains (AHN) remains uncertain.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-

TOF MS) is based on the protein composition of the microbial cell, particularly ribosomal

protein contents, and can discriminate clinical and environmental species. This technique is

effective to identify anaerobic bacteria in the routine clinical microbiology laboratory setting

[2-4]. Some clinical case reports used this technique to correctly identify Capnocytophaga

species at the genus level [5, 6].

The MALDI-TOF MS has also been used to detect several beta-lactamases, such as

extended-spectrum  -lactamase  (ESBL)  [7,  8]  and  carbapenemases  [2,  9,  l0].  Only  a  few

studies screened beta-lactamases in anaerobes, such as the class B metallo-beta-lactamase

encoded  by  cfiA  in  Bacteroides  fragilis  [2]  or  carbapenemases  [9,  ll].  The  prevalence  of

beta-lactamase producing Capnocytophaga sp. is increasing in the human oral cavity, as

demonstrated by the high prevalence of cfxA-positive PCR strains [l2-l4], which is the major

cause of third generation cephalosporin resistance in Capnocytophaga sp. The cfxA gene,

conferring constant resistance to third generation cephalosporins, especially cefotaxime

[l5], has been described on plasmids and/or on chromosomes harbouring mobile genetic

elements. This ability to gene mobilisation can be responsible for resistance gene

dissemination and transfer [l2]. When a beta-lactamase-producing Capnocytophaga strain is

detected  in  a clinical sample, the empirical antimicrobial treatment administered to the

patient should often be  rapidly modified. However, the detection of the cfxA gene is not

sufficient to assert the resistance. In previous work, we showed that the expression of this

gene  is  not  always  constant:  if  lst  and  2nd  generation  cephalosporins  are  most  often

affected by the CfxA beta-lactamase, the phenotypic expression of resistance for

cephalosporins  of  3rd  generation  is  reported  variable  according  to  the  strains  [l6].

Expression of cfxA genes (cfxA mRNA levels) was quantified by using quantitative PCR, in

cfxA PCR-positive isolates differentiated by their beta-lactam resistance profiles. One isolate

remained susceptible to beta-lactams (despite a positive cfxA PCR), and the cfxA gene was

not expressed (Ct value identical to distilled water used as negative control). But the

normalized Ct values for the third-generation cephalosporins were not directly related to

MIC levels. This expression could also be influenced by replacing the sequence in the cfxA

gene, and enhanced expression related to the proximity of mobile elements such as mobA

[l6].  A  simple  and  rapid  method  for  detecting  the  presence  of  the  CfxA  beta-lactamase

would therefore be useful for better interpreting the PCR results. Wybo et al. [2] managed to

differentiate cfiA-positive from cfiA-negative isolates in a routine laboratory setting and so

pinpoint B. fragilis strains potentially resistant to carbapenems. In the same way, we hoped

to discriminate negative and positive cfxA strains: culture of bacteria with cefotaxime was

also tested to confirm the experiment.

The aim of this study was to use MALDI-TOF MS for rapid species identification of

Capnocytophaga. The study also tested the discriminatory power of this technique to

differentiate the cefotaxime resistant from cefotaxime susceptible Capnocytophaga strains.

2.1 Strains used

Reference strains (n=5) were used for this study: C. sputigena ATCC 33595, C. sputigena

ATCC  336l2,  C.  gingivalis  ATCC  33624,  C.  ochracea  ATCC  27872,  and  C.  granulosa  ATCC

5l502. Clinical strains of Capnocytophaga sp. (n=48) were isolated from routine cultures, at

the Teaching Hospital of Rennes (France). Clinical strains were isolated from oral swabs

(n=30) and sputum samples (n=8) on TBBP (Trypticase-blood-bacitracin-polymyxin B) agar

[l7], and from surgical bone samples (n=4), abscesses (n=4), and blood samples (n=2) on

horse blood agar (Oxoid). All samples were conserved in frozen stock cultures (Cryobanks,

MAST diagnostics), and cultured on horse blood agar in an anaerobic chamber for 24 to 48 h

at 37degC for further experiments.



2.2 Susceptibility testing

The MICs were determined by Etest methodology (Etest (r), BioMerieux, France), and

interpreted according to CLSI recommendations for anaerobes [l8], since no breakpoint for

third generation cephalosporins (as cefotaxime) is currently available for anaerobes,

according  to  EUCAST  recommendations  [l9].  The  CLSI  breakpoints  of  cefotaxime  for

susceptible,  intermediate,  and  resistant  strains  were  l6  mg/L,  32  mg/L,  and  ;?64  mg/L,

respectively.



2.3 PCR amplification

Amplification of the cfxA gene by PCR was performed as previously described [20]. Briefly,

the	primers	used	were:	cfxAl	(5'-CTTTGTCGGCAAATAAAGAT-3')	and	cfxA4	(5'-

TGAACGAGGAATGAGTGTGG-3'),	generating	a	580bp	fragment	and	cfxA5	(5'-

TGGTTAATGTCGCTCAAACA-3')   and   cfxA6 (5'-TCAAAGCAAGTGCAGTTTAAGA-3'),

generating a 507bp fragment. A 966-bp consensus sequence of cfxA3 was then determined.

The amplification conditions were 94degC for l min, 55degC for l min, and 72degC for l min (35

cycles).

Sequencing  of  the  l6S  rRNA  gene  was  used  as  a  reference  method  for  Capnocytophaga

species identification, based on previous work [2l]. Real-time PCR was performed with Sybr

green to target the 5' part of the l6S rRNA gene (forward primer 27F, 5'-AGA GTT TGA TCM

TGG CTC AG-3'; reverse primer 685R3, 5'-TCT RCG CAT TYC ACC GCT AC-3'; 658-bp

amplification product; GenBank accession number NR_024570).  The  corresponding

amplicons were sequenced in both strands and assembled, and the consensus sequences

were compared with those in the Bioinformatics Bacteria Identification (BIBI) and BLAST

databases. The rates of concordance between l6S rRNA gene PCR and bacteriological results

were based on results at the genus (;?96% similarity) and species (;?98% similarity) levels.

Positive and negative controls were added in each series [2l]. To control DNA extraction and

confirm the absence of PCR inhibitors, a fragment of the human beta-globin gene was

amplified for each negative sample.



2.4 Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry {MALDI-TOF

MS}

MALDI-TOF MS (Biotyper, Bruker) analyses were performed in positive linear mode in the

range of 2000-20,000 masses-to-charge ratio (m/z), and used to identify the isolates to the

level of species. Colonies were selected after culturing on horse blood agar in an anaerobic

chamber for 24 to 48 h, in the absence of antibiotic or around to the cefotaxime disk

(BioRad, 30 ug). Colony spotting was performed in triplicate and spectra were obtained and

analyzed with MALDI Biotyper 2.0 software and references (Bruker Daltonik, GmbH,

Bremen, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the direct colony

method, bacteria were applied as a thin film onto a 96-spot steel plate (Bruker Daltonics)

and allowed to dry at room temperature. Subsequently, l.2 ul of MALDI matrix (a saturated

solution of a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid [HCCA; Bruker Daltonics] in 50% acetonitrile

and 2.5% trifluoroacetic acid) was applied to the colony and allowed to dry before testing.

For the extraction method, l to 2 colonies were extracted as already described [22]. Each

series of measurements was preceded by calibration with a bacterial test standard (BTS

255343; Bruker Daltonik), to calibrate the instrument and validate the run. Negative controls

were a matrix deposit alone and Brucella broth (supplemented with 5% blood, vitamin Kl

and cefotaxime (0.5mg/L)). For identification, scores and reproducibility were considered

according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bruker). Results of the pattern matching

process  were  expressed  as  log  (score)  values  ranging  from  0  to  3.  Values  from  0-l.6999

indicated not suitable identification, >l.7 indicated relationships on the genus level, and >2.0

indicated relationships on the species level (score: 2.3 to 3: high probability of identification

to the species level, 2 to 2.2999: high probability of identification to the genus level and

probable identification to the species level, l.7-l.999: probable identification to the genus

level). The interpretation considered two independent parameters: the value of the

homology   score   and   the   reproducibility   of   the   identification   obtained   (from   l0

measurements carried out after laser impacts where the same bacterial species must be

found at least three times with the highest scores).

To test if MALDI-TOF MS was able to differentiate between cfxA-negative and cfxA-positive

isolates, bacterial pellets were also extracted after incubation of each isolate in the presence

of cefotaxime (0.5 mg/L) in Brucella broth supplemented with 5% blood and vitamin Kl (l

mg/L) under anaerobic conditions for 6 h. Identification was performed, as indicated above,

from a deposit of a drop of pellet left to dry and score-oriented dendrogram of matrix-

assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry profiles were

compared.

The MALDI-TOF MS spectral data resulting from the analysis of 53 isolates were processed

using the Bruker database software to identify species-specific masses that were then used

to generate dendrograms. A class dendrogram of all the study isolates was constructed (with

the correlation distance measured by the average linkage algorithm; Euclidean distances) of

the Biotyper 2.0 software (Bruker Daltonics) [23]. The MALDI-TOF spectra similarity

dendrogram between cfxA positive and negative strains, based on the mass  spectral

patterns, was used to study dispersion of spectra [24].



3. Results

3.1 Identifications of strains by MALDI-TOF MS and l6S rRNA gene sequencing

The  MALDI-TOF  MS  and  l6S  rRNA  gene  sequencing  of  the  clinical  and  reference

isolates clearly identified all strains as Capnocytophaga (l00% agreement) at the genus level,

and 4l/53 (77.4%) were identified as the same at the species level (Table l), with a score

>l.8  and  a  reproducibility  >4  (minimum  of  3/l0  replicates  had  MALDI  confidence  scores

>l.8). Both methods identified the C. sputigena (n=3l) and C. ochracea (n=3) strains. The

four  Capnocytophaga  AHN  {AHN9576/AHN9798/AHN847l/ChDc)  strains  identified  by  l6S

rRNA sequencing were characterized as C. sputigena by MALDI-TOF MS. The six C.

leadbetteri strains recognized by l6S rRNA sequencing were identified as Capnocytophaga.

sp. by MALDI-TOF MS. One strain classified as Capnocytophaga geno sp., C. granulosa and

another as C. gingivalis by l6S rRNA sequencing were identified as C. sputigena, C. gingivalis

and C. granulosa, respectively, by MALDI-TOF MS. The MALDI-TOF MS technique had limited

ability to discriminate between C. gingivalis and C. granulosa (two misidentified strains), but

these species were similar, as shown on the dendrogram of all Capnocytophaga species

identified using MALDI-TOF MS (Figure l).

3.2	Susceptibility testing

From the total clinical Capnocytophaga sp. (n=48), 35 strains were cefotaxime-susceptible,

three were intermediate, and l0 were resistant, according to CLSI criteria [l7]. The MICs of

cefotaxime were: MIC50 = l.5 and MIC90 ;?256 mg/L (range: 0.0l6->256 mg/L). Among these

Capnocytophaga sp. isolates, the cfxA gene was amplified by PCR in 42 (87.5%) all resistant

to  cefalotin  (data  not  shown):  l3  strains  were  resistant/intermediate  and  29  remained

phenotypically susceptible to cefotaxime despite a positive cfxA PCR. Five of the latter (four

from saliva and one from osteo-articular fluid) cfxA+, susceptible to cefotaxime with MIC

range:   0.0l6-0.5   mg/L   were   found   to   be   gene   misexpressed   and/or   beta-lactamase

inactivated, as previously suggested. The five reference strains were cfxA PCR negative and

susceptible to beta-lactams.

3.3 MALDI-TOF spectra similarity dendrogram

The MALDI-TOF spectra similarity dendrogram, in which the strains were dispersed

irrespective of their mass spectral patterns, was unsuccessful in differentiating susceptible

and resistant strains (data not shown).



4. Discussion

In a previous study, Conrads et al. [25] used oligonucleotide probes and

demonstrated  that   the  dendrogram  of  l6S  rRNA  sequences  of  the  Capnocytophaga

reference strains showed a very close relationship, especially C. granulosa and C. gingivalis

(97.7% similarity) and C. ochracea and C. sputigena (95.0% similarity). Previously, MALDI-TOF

MS was used with success to identify strict anaerobes, such as Bacteroides [26] or Prevotella

[27], with clinical isolates of Prevotella sp. identified to the species (62.7%) and genus

(73.5%) levels. Recently, Magnette et al. [28] showed that MALDI-TOF MS provided a reliable

identification to the species level for l00% of 45 blind-coded Capnocytophaga canimorsus

and C. cynodegmi, but only following the establishment of a complementary homemade

reference database. Using MALDI-TOF MS in this study, we found improved Capnocytophaga

genus  level  identification  (l00%)  and  a  good  human  oral  Capnocytophaga  species  level

identification (77.4%). The six C. leadbetteri and four C. AHN strains (recognized by l6S rRNA

sequencing) were identified by MALDI-TOF MS as C. spp. and C. sputigena, respectively. This

result was not surprising because C. leadbetteri and C. AHN do not exist in the Biotyper-

Bruker database used, as was previously observed [4]. In addition, the MALDI-TOF MS

method could not completely discriminate between C. gingivalis and C. granulosa, a finding

that is consistent with previous reports using multilocus enzyme electrophoretic analysis and

serotyping of immunoglobulin Al proteases [29]. Thus, our results suggest that MALDI-TOF

MS can be used for rapid and reliable identification of most clinical Capnocytophaga strains.

We also investigated if MALDI-TOF MS could be used to detect the presence of the

beta-lactamase CfxA (mainly responsible for cefotaxime resistance) or one of its metabolites

in Capnocytophaga strains. The MALDI-TOF MS method failed to detect cfxA positive

Capnocytophaga strains (compared to cfxA negative strains), cultured in the presence or

absence of cefotaxime. Most previous studies used inhibitors of beta-lactamases (ESBL or

carbapenemases) to reveal by MALDI-TOF MS the intermediates of beta-lactamases [30] or

enzyme inhibition [3l]. We did not do this because the intrinsic activity of all beta-lactamase

inhibitors was demonstrated in Capnocytophaga species [32]. Wybo et al. [2] demonstrated

that MALDI-TOF MS could be used to differentiate between cfiA-positive and cfiA-negative

Bacteroides strains, cultured on fastidious anaerobic agar at 35degC in an anaerobic chamber

for 24 to 48 h, without use of antibiotic or beta-lactamase inhibitors. This result was

confirmed by Fenyvesi et al. [33], who characterized 5/60 cfiA positive strains using this

method. In our study, we could not discriminate between cefotaxime susceptible (cfxA-

positive) and resistant (cfxA-negative) strains using the MALDI-TOF MS method and MALDI

Biotyper 2.0 software, as recommended by Wybo et al. [2].

The limits of this technique for beta-lactamase detection have already been

highlighted.   Trevino   et   al.   [ll]   used   MALDI-TOF   MS   for   rapid   characterization   of

carbapenemase-producing  Enterobacteriaceae  and genetic diversity among carbapenemase-

producing strains. Trevino et al. [ll] also showed that fingerprinting analyses by automated

repetitive extragenic palindromic-polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR) (DiversiLab system)

showed higher discriminatory power than MALDI-TOF MS for clonal strain typing. With this

last method, distinct mass spectra were obtained only within a mass range of 2,000 to

20,000 Da using whole cell MALDI-TOF MS [34], and the mass range of the CfxA beta-

lactamase was estimated to 35,275 Da and CfiA to be 27,260 Da. By MALDI-TOF MS, only

degradation products of the beta-lactam cefotaxime might have been detected, but no

difference in profiles was observed when Capnocytophaga strains were cultured with and

without antibiotic. Moreover, the expression of CfxA enzyme has been described as variable

with different MICs reported. Wybo et al. [2] suggested that the cfiA gene was not always

activated, and Soki et al. [35] hypothesized that the cfiA gene was activated by its own

promotor. The differentiation of cfiA-negative and cfiA-positive Bacteroides fragilis [2] was

probably due to a selection bias in identifying strains, because the cfiA gene, encoding the

unique carbapenemase found in Bacteroides, was restricted to division II Bacteroides fragilis

strains [36].



5. Conclusion

In conclusion, MALDI-TOF MS can be used for rapid and low cost oral human

Capnocytophaga genus identification. But the limits of this technique was the absence of

some species (C. leadbetteri, C. AHN) in the Biotyper-Bruker database used in this study,

and its inability to completely discriminate between C. gingivalis and C. granulosa. This

method	was	not	also	suitable	for	quickly	detecting	beta-lactamase	producing

Capnocytophaga strains.

Figure 1 Score-oriented dendrogram of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-

flight mass spectrometry profiles generated by the default setting in MALDI Biotyper

software version 2.0. for 53 Capnocytophaga strains cultured on blood agar for 48 h under

anaerobic conditions. Reference strains were C. sputigena ATCC 33595 (strain 40), C.

sputigena  ATCC  336l2  (strain 4l),  C.  ochracea  ATCC  27872  (strain  42), C.  gingivalis  ATCC

33624  (strain  43),  and  C.  granulosa  ATCC  5l502  (strain  44).  The  misidentified  (compared

with the l6S rRNA gene sequencing identification technique) species were: C. granulosa/C.

gingivalis (n=l), C. spp./C. leadbetteri (n=6), C. sputigena/C. AHN (n=4), and C. sputigena/C

sp. (n=l). Two distinct clades appeared on dendrogram using MALDI-TOF corresponding to:

clade at the top: clade for C. gingivalis/granulosa, and clade down: clade for other

Capnocytophaga spp.
