Fecal Microbiota Transplantation
Fecal microbiota transplantation, also known as stool transplantation,
is a procedure in which stool from a healthy donor is placed into another patient's intestine.
Candidate Patients for Stool Transplantation
Stool transplantation is used for difficult-to-treat or recurrent (3 or more episodes) Clostridium difficile infection. The intestines contain hundreds of types of bacteria. When the numbers of healthy bacteria decrease, often because of antibiotic use, harmful C difficile bacteria may proliferate and cause diarrhea. Although cer- tain antibiotics treat C difficile, some individuals may not respond to these drugs; these patients may be helped by a stool transplant. Transplanting stool from healthy donors restores the balance of healthy bacteria and helps clear infection.

How Is Stool Transplantation Performed?
There are different ways to transplant stool, but in most cases, patients have a colonoscopy during which a health care clinician puts small amounts of liquefied and filtered stool into the colon. Other methods may be used, such as through a feeding tube, enema, or capsules.
Stool may be available from healthy volunteers, a family member, or a friend. Stool donors should be free of illnesses and undergo a thorough medical evaluation to ensure optimal health; blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus and hepati-

tis A, B, and C viruses; and stool tests for bacterial, viral, and para- sitic infections.
Symptomatic patients may need to undergo therapy with an- tibiotics to manage C difficile, which are then stopped at least 24 hours before the procedure for most patients. Other antibiotics should ideally be discontinued.
It is not recommended to perform stool transplantation athome without guidance from a physician.

Side Effects
The side effects of stool transplantation include mild and self- limiting abdominal discomfort, cramping, bloating, diarrhea or con- stipation, and, rarely, transmission of diseases that cannot be tested for by screening. You should seek medical attention if you experi- ence fever, severe abdominal pain or swelling, or vomiting or stool that contains fresh (bright red) or old (black) blood.

Other Uses and Insurance Coverage
Stool transplantation is being studied for treatment of other disor- ders such as inflammatory bowel disease, but its use in these con- ditions is limited to research settings.
The US Food and Drug Administration permits stool transplan- tation after adequate donor screening and a discussion about risks and benefits. There may be a need for insurance prior authorization be- fore stool transplantation. Contact your insurance company.
