Abstract
Background: Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) represents a chronic wide-spectrum of liver injury caused by
consistently excessive alcohol intake. Few satisfactory advances have been made in management of ALD. Thus,
novel and more practical treatment options are urgently needed. Flaxseed oil (FO) is rich in a-linolenic acid (ALA), a plant-derived n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). However, the impact of dietary FO on chronic alcohol consumption remains unknown.
Methods: In this study, we assessed possible effects of dietary FO on attenuation of ALD and associated
mechanisms in mice. Firstly, mice were randomly allocated into four groups: pair-fed (PF) with corn oil (CO)
group (PF/CO); alcohol-fed (AF) with CO group (AF/CO); PF with FO group (PF/FO); AF with FO group (AF/FO).
Each group was fed modified Lieber-DeCarli liquid diets containing isocaloric maltose dextrin a control or alcohol with corn oil and flaxseed oil, respectively. After 6 weeks feeding, mice were euthanized and associated
indications were investigated.
Results: Body weight (BW) was significantly elevated in AF/FO group compared with AF/CO group. Dietary
FO reduced the abnormal elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in chronic ethanol consumption. Amelioration of these parameters as well as liver injury via HE staining in
dietary FO supplementation in ALD demonstrated that dietary FO can effectively benefit for the protection against ALD. To further understand the underlying mechanisms, we investigated the inflammatory cytokine levels and gut microbiota. A series of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-10, were
determined. As a result, TNF-a, IL-1b and IL-6 were decreased in AF/FO group compared with control group; IL-10 showed no significant alteration between AF/CO and AF/FO groups (p > 0.05). Sequencing and analysis of gut microbiota gene indicated that a reduction of Porphyromonadaceae and Parasutterella, as well as an
increase in Firmicutes and Parabacteroides, were seen in AF group compared with PF control. Furthermore, dietary FO in ethanol consumption group induced a significant reduction in Proteobacteria and
Porphyromonadaceae compared with AF/CO group.
Conclusion: Dietary FO ameliorates alcoholic liver disease via anti-inflammation and modulating gut microbiota, thus can potentially serve as an inexpensive interventions for the prevention and treatment of ALD.

Background
Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) represents a chronic wide- spectrum of liver injury caused by consistently excessive alcohol intake, ranking major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide among people who abuse alcohol . ALD includes a histological spectrum of liver injure ran- ging from simple steatosis to hepatitis characterized by in- flammation, with potential progression to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Hepatitis, with an occurrence of approximately 10 to 35% in chronic drinkers and responsible for more than 1/3 significant morbidity and mortality, has been thought to play a crucial role in reversible pathological process of ALD -. Up to now, few satisfactory ad- vances have been made in management of ALD, except abstinence from alcohol [ . Thus, novel and more practical treatment options are urgently needed.
Gut microbiota play a crucial role in progression and pathogenesis of ALD. Accumulating evidence has re- vealed that gut microbiota is closely associated with liver in ALD as the gut-liver axis   Impairment of gut microbiota homeostasis in ALD induces proliferation of gram negative pathogenic bacteria, which generate lipo- polysaccharide (LPS) and translocate to liver tissue as a trigger for hepatitis by binding to TLR-4 (Toll-like receptor-4) on macrophages and neutrophils. Moreover, Campos Canesso et al.  showed  that  the  administration of alcohol to germ-free mice is associated to the absence of liver inflammation and injury, indicating that alcohol alone is not sufficient for the development of liver dis- ease, and that the presence of microbiota alterations is also necessary  Thus, modulation of gut microbiota dysbiosis could attenuate hepatic injury in ALD 
Flaxseed oil (FO) is rich in plant-derived omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), mainly a-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3 n-3). Clinical studies reported that a low levels of n-3PUFAs in serum and liver tissue is a common charac- teristic of ALD patients [  Dietary FO prevented against acute alcoholic hepatic steatosis via ameliorating  lipid homeostasis at adipose tissue-liver axis in mice  However, the impact of dietary FO on inflammation  and  gut micorbiota in chronic ALD remains unknown.
In the present study, we assessed effects of dietary FO on attenuation of ALD and associated mechanisms in mice. Results of the study may contribute to understand- ing the role played by FO in ALD and the complexity of the interplay among the diet, gut microbiota, inflamma- tion and ALD.


Methods
Animals and diet
Sixty male C57BL/6 J mice (8 weeks old) were obtained from Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co. Ltd., Beijing, China. The animals were housed in individual

cages in a temperature-controlled (22 +- 1 degC), light-cycled (12-h light/dark cycle) room.
All liquid diets for mice feeding  were  purchased  from TROPHIC Animal Feed High-tech Co., Ltd., Nantong, China.


Experimental design
After an 1-week period of acclimation to the control liquid diet, maleC57BL/6 J mice (n = 60, 8 weeks old) were fed the modified Lieber-DeCarli liquid diets as previously de- scribed []. Briefly, mice were randomly allocated into four groups (15 animals/group): (a) pair-fed (PF) with corn oil (CO) group (PF/CO), mice were fed modified Lieber- DeCarli CO liquid diets containing isocaloric maltose dex- trin as CO control; (b) alcohol-fed (AF) with CO group (AF/CO), mice were fed ethanol-containing modified Lieber-DeCarli CO liquid diets; (c) PF with flaxseed oil (FO) group (PF/FO), mice were fed modified Lieber- DeCarli FO liquid diets containing isocaloric maltose dex- trin as FO control; (d) AF with FO group (AF/FO), mice were fed ethanol-containing modified Lieber-DeCarli FO liquid diets. Mice in AF groups were fed the modified Lieber-DeCarli liquid diets containing ethanol with an en- ergy composition of 18% protein, 19% carbohydrate, 35% fat and 28% ethanol, whereas animals in the PF groups were fed the modified Lieber-DeCarli liquid diets, in which, isocaloric maltose dextrin (carbohydrate) replaced ethanol, and 35% of the total calories were provided by ei- ther corn oil (rich in n-6 PUFAs) or flaxseed oil (rich in n- 3 PUFAs). Components of the liquid diets and the fatty acid composition of dietary fats are shown in  Add- itional file (Table S1) and Additional file (Table S2), respectively. Groups (a) and (c) were the pair-fed con- trols for groups (b) and (d), respectively. Liquid diets were freshly prepared from powder daily  according  to the manufacturer's instruction. Average daily volume of liquid intake per mouse  was  monitored  and  calculated in AF groups. Mice in PF groups consume equal amounts of diets. After 6 weeks of feeding, mice were then euthanized and associated indications were inves- tigated. Blood samples were collected in ethylene di- amine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)-containing tubes and centrifuged (1200 x g for 15 min) to obtain plasma sam- ples. All plasma samples were stored at -80 degC for fur- ther analysis.


Determination of plasma AST and ALT levels
As biochemical indicators of liver function, plasma aspar- tate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities in each group were respectively deter- mined using AU400 automatic biochemical analyzer (Olympus, Japan).






Determination of plasma endotoxin
Plasma LPS levels in each mouse/group were measured with limulus amebocyte lysate kit (Xiamen Bioendo Technology Co.Ltd, Xiamen, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

HE staining
After mice sacrifice, liver tissues were immediately fixed with formalin and processed with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining to evaluate liver damage including hepatocyte fatty change, inflammatory cells, degeneration and necrosis.

ELISA assays
Liver tissues (0.5 g) were homogenized in 1.5 ml ice-cold 50 mM Tris buffer (pH7.2, Tris with 1% Triton-X 100 and 0.1% protease inhibitor) and shaken on ice for 90 min. Then the homogenates were centrifuged at 3,000 x g for 15 min. Supernatants were collected for determination of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, IL (interleukin)-1b, IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations. Measurements of each cytokine level in plasma or the supernatants of liver tissues were performed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) according to the manufacturer's instructions (e-Bioscience, CA, USA).

Gut microbiota analysis
The fecal microbial 16S rRNA gene sequencing and ana- lysis were investigated as previously described After 6 weeks feeding, five mice per group were randomly se- lected and transferred to fresh sterilized cages. The fresh feces of each mouse was respectively collected, immedi- ately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at -80 degC until DNA extraction.
Microbial DNA was extracted from 200 mg feces sam- ples as previously described  Briefly, this sample (200 mg) was resuspended in 4 ml of 4 M guanidine thiocyanate-0.1 M Tris (pH7.5) and 600 ml of 10% N- lauroyl sarcosine. The feces  was ground with a  mortar on ice, 250 mg of the ground  material was transferred  to a 2-ml screw-cap polypropylene microcentrifuge tube,  and the remaining material was frozen. After addition of 500 ml of 5% N-lauroyl sarcosine 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH8.0), the 2 ml tube was incubated at 70 degC for 1 h. One volume (750 ml) of 0.1 mm diameter silica beads (Sigma) previously sterilized by autoclaving was added, and the tube was shakenat maximum speed for 10 min    in a Vibro shaker  (Retsch).  Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (15 mg) was added to the tube, which was vortexed and centrifuged for 3 min at 12,000 x g. After recovery of the supernatant, the pellet was washed with 500 ml of TENP (50  mM  Tris  [pH8],  20  mM  EDTA  [pH8],  100  mM
NaCl, 1% polyvinylpolypyrrolidone) and centrifuged for 3 min at 12,000 x g, and the new supernatant was added to  the  first  supernatant.  The washing  step  was repeated


three times. Pooled supernatants (about 2 ml)  were briefly centrifuged to remove particles and  then  split  into two 2 ml tubes. Nucleic acids were precipitated by the addition of 1 volume of isopropanol for 10 min at room temperature and centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 x g. Pellets were resuspended and pooled  in 450 ml of 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH8) and 50 ml of   5 M potassium acetate.  The tube  was placed on ice  for 90 min and centrifuged at 16,000x g for 30 min. The supernatant was transferred to  a  new  tube  containing 20 ml of RNase (1 mg/ml) and incubated at 37 degC for      30 min. Nucleic acids were precipitated by addition of    50 ml of 3 M sodium acetate and 1 ml of absolute ethanol. The tube was incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and nucleic acids were recovered by centrifugation at 20,000 x g for 15 min. The DNA pellet was finally washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and  resuspended  in 400 ml TE buffer. DNA concentration and purity were analyzed by Nanodrop (Thermo). Size distribution (predominantly around 20 kb) were estimated by elec- trophoresis (Additional file  Figure S1).  Extracted DNA was stored at -20 degC until use.
Sequences involving V3 and V4 16S rDNA hypervari-
able regions were amplified by TranStart FastPfu DNA Polymerase (TransGen Biotech, China) using the follow- ing primers (5' to 3'): 341 F-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG, 805R-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC.    PCR   products
were analyzed and separated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel (containing SYB green), then purified with Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Germany). Sequencing libraries were generated using TruSeq DNA PCR manu- facturer's instructions and index codes were added. The li- brary was sequenced and analyzed using an Illumina HisSeq2500 platform by Shanghai Tai Chang gene tech- nology co., LTD., China

Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed using Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Soft- ware Inc., CA, USA). Results were represented as mean +- SEM. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Turkey multiple-comparison test was used to deter- mine statistical difference between experimental groups. Results were considered significant at P < 0.05.

Results
Routine parameters of mice in diverse dietary groups There was no significant difference in initial body weight (BW) among four groups. However, after 6 weeks feeding, the final BW in AF/CO group was significantly decreased, compared with that in paired PF/CO group (P < 0.01) or AF/FO group (P < 0.01). The final BW in AF/FO showed no change compared with PF/FO. These results demon- strated that flaxseed oil maintained the BW during chronic ethanol feeding. Liver weight in AF group (AF/






CO group and AF/FO group) was significantly elevated comparing to that in PF group (PF/CO group and PF/FO group) (Table . Similarly, the ratio of liver-to-body weight in alcohol exposure group regardless of dietary fat was significantly increased compared with that in no etha- nol pair-fed group. In addition, the plasma AST and ALT levels in AF/CO group were significantly elevated by 2.5- fold (185.9 +- 13.3 vs. 74.8 +- 8.6) and 2-fold (104.8 +- 11.4
vs. 52.6 +- 5.9) compared with that in pair-fed PO/CO group, respectively. However, these AST and ALT eleva- tions in AF/CO group were effectively suppressed by diet- ary FO administration in AF/FO group (185.9 +- 13.3 vs. 109.7 +- 7.2, 104.8 +- 11.4 vs. 75.2 +- 6.1) (Table .


Dietary FO attenuated hepatic histopathological injury and reduced plasma LPS levels
According to HE staining for liver in diverse groups, hep- atic fatty change, necrosis and inflammation were serious in chronic alcohol feeding group (AF/CO), whereas long- term dietary FO distinctly alleviated the alcohol-induced hepatic histopathological injury (Fig. ).
Plasma LPS in AF/FO group was significantly de- creased compared with AF/CO group (P < 0.0001), but still higher than PF/CO or PF/FO group (Fig.  dem- onstrating that dietary FO possessed ability to attenuated LPS generation from Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria.


Dietary FO reduced plasma inflammatory cytokine levels in ALD
After chronic ethanol feeding, we found obvious elevated plasma TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-10 in AF/CO and AF/ FO groups compared with these cytokines in pair-fed group (Fig. ). However, dietary FO attenuated ethanol-inducing abnormal elevated TNF-a concentration, compared with  that in PF control group (P = 0.0095, Fig. a). Similarly, plasma IL-1b (P = 0.007, Fig.  and IL-6 (P < 0.0001,
Fig. ) levels in AF/FO were also significantly reduced in comparison with those two cytokines in AF/CO group. It showed no significant difference in plasma IL-10 level be- tween AF/CO and AF/FO groups (P = 0.3229, Fig. d).


Dietary FO reduced liver inflammatory cytokine levels in ALD
We detected the cytokine  production  in liver  tissue and also found elevated TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6  and  IL-10 in AF group compared with  PF group. Similarly, TNF-  a (p < 0.001, Fig. ), IL-1b (P = 0.0021, Fig.  and
IL-6 (P = 0.0022, Fig. ) levels in AF/FO group were sig- nificantly decreased compared with those three cytokines in AF/CO group. It showed also no significant difference in IL-10 level in supplementary FO group during chronic ethanol feeding (P = 0.1635, Fig. ).

Dietary FO modulated gut microbiota in ALD
Gut microbiota have been increasingly thought to play a critical role in ALD development in mice and humans     - To investigate whether the observed differ- ences in liver inflammation among AF/CO, AF/FO and those PF groups were associated with the difference in  the intestinal microbiota, we performed fecal metage- nomic analysis. Rationality of sequencing data was evalu- ated by rarefaction curve (Additional file Figure S2). It was observed that the rarefaction curve tended to be flat when the sequence number increased to 20,000, indicat- ing that the amount of sequencing data was reasonable.
The overall bacterial community structure was analyzed using unweighted UniFrac (Pcoa) (Fig. ) and weighted dis- tance matrices (NMDS) (Additional file Figure S3). Pcoa showed that chronic alcohol consumption induced an obvi- ous difference in terms of species in fecal samples com- pared with pair-fed control feeding (Fig. ). There's no obvious change in terms of species between AF/CO group and AF/FO group (Fig. ). Interestingly, during nor- mal liquid feeding, supplementary FO seemingly altered the fecal species compared with CO feeding (Fig.  Similar results from NMDS analysis were obtained (Additional file : Figure S3).
At phylum level, the proportion of Firmicutes was not- ably increased in alcohol feeding groups compared with those in the PF groups (P = 0.0159, Fig.  Meanwhile, there's no change between  AF/FO  and  AF/CO  groups (P = 0.8385, Fig.  Bacteroidetes accounted for more than half of proportion in diverse administration groups



Table 1 Routine parameters of mice in diverse dietary groups in ALD





and decreased in AF/CO group  in  comparison with other three groups but with no  significant  difference. The proportion of Proteobacteria showed  no  alteration in chronic consumption of alcohol compared with non- ethanol controls. The proportion of Proteobacteria in AF/ FO group was significantly lower than that in AF/CO group (0.074 +- 0.009 vs. 0.117 +- 0.003, P < 0.0001) or PF/
FO  group   (0.074 +- 0.009   vs.   0.124 +- 0.009, P < 0.0001).
Taken together, our data revealed that under this experi- mental condition a combination of ethanol and dietary FO (AF/FO) had a major effect on Proteobacteria but with limited effects on Bacteriodetes and Firmicutes.
At genus level, we found Porphyromonadaceae  was the most prevalent genus in the control groups (PF/CO and PF/FO) and obviously reduced in dietary alcohol ad- ministration groups (P < 0.0001, Fig.  Moreover, the proportion of Porphyromonadaceae in AF/FO group showed lower than that in AF/CO group but without significance (0.176 +- 0.026 vs. 0.146 +- 0.013, P = 0.0503).
In contrast, Parabacteroides was sharply elevated in the AF) groups (AF/CO and AF/FO) compared with the control groups (P = 0.0211, Fig.  Additionally, Para- sutterella was the second prevalent genus in each group. Alcohol administration induced a  significant  reduction  of Parasutterella in comparison to that in the control groups (P = 0.0005). Collectively, our genus results indi- cating  that  chronic  alcohol  consumption  obviously  al-
tered the initial proportion of genus components, mainly including Porphyromonadaceae, Parabacteroides and Parasutterella.
Furthermore, heatmap also showed that dietary FO (AF/FO) had a major effect on Proteobacteria, with





























limited effects on Bacteriodetes and Firmicutes. More- over, many other tiny bacteria showed obvious difference between AF and PF groups, such as Barnesiella, Psychro- bacter, Deltaproteobacteria, Acinetobacter, Flavonifractor, and Lactococcus (Fig. ). However, diverse dietary oil had a less effect of on the influence of these seldom bacteria proportion (Fig. ).

Discussion
In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of long-term dietary FO for chronic ALD. By in vivo 6- weeks treatment of ALD in mice, our study demon- strated that supplementary FO showed more effective in reduction of hepatic damage, suggesting that this inex- pensive interventions exhibited preventive and thera- peutic potential. Our further study revealed that this effective treatment may associated with altered gut microbiota and the decrease of liver inflammation.
Numerous studies indicated that alcohol exposure sig- nificantly reduced final BW in chronic ALD [, ]. In this study, we also found that BW was lower in AF/CO group, although the caloric intake was identical among all groups. Dietary FO efficiently improved the final BW in ALD compared with AF/CO, indicating that FO may positively affect nutrients absorption and efficiency of calorie utilization in gastrointestinal tract in ALD. Liver weight and relative liver weights in AF group regardless of dietary oil significantly increased, which was consist- ent with previous reports , suggesting that  substitut- ing FO for CO in chronic ethanol intake had no effect    on liver weight.
In this study, we found abnormal elevated plasma ALT and AST levels in AF/CO group, indicating alcohol

induced liver injury Significant reductions of plasma ALT and AST in AF/FO group revealed that supplemen- tary FO alleviated liver damage caused by chronic etha- nol feeding. Similarly, dietary fish oil, rich in long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, mainly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), has  showed also the ability to attenuate liver injury by redu- cing ALT and AST levels in ALD   Inexpensive dietary FO-derived ALA, served as a precursor for the synthesis of EPA and DHA, can converse to EPA and DHA in the blood and tissues ].
LPS, a trigger for hepatic inflammation in ALD, translo- cates to liver via portal vein and binds to TLR-4 of antigen presenting cells (APCs) to induce inflammatory immune response and finally cause chronic hepatitis [, ]. In this study, plasma LPS in AF/FO group was obviously de- creased, demonstrating that dietary FO may decrease gut permeability and reduce LPS translocation from intestines to the liver and systematic circulation in ALD, which con- tributed to the reduction of inflammatory response in the liver. This attenuation may be associated with intestinal innate immune system and the underlying mechanism needs to be further researched [].
Activation of Kupffer cells and neutrophils induces oxi- dative stress and produces inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a, IL-1b and IL-6 that cause apoptosis and necro- sis of hepatocytes and consequently result in liver injury [, ]. Our results showed that TNF-a, IL-1b and IL- 6 levels of plasma and liver tissue in AF/FO group were significantly decreased, demonstrating that dietary FO al- leviated hepatic inflammation via anti-inflammatory cyto- kines. IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine released by Kupffer cells and monocytes [, ]. But in this study, we






































found IL-10 showed no difference among all groups, which was not paralleled with previous study We spec- ulated that IL-10 maybe play a complicated role in imbal- ance between regulation of pro- and anti- inflammatory mediators during chronic ethanol exposure. Additionally, regulatory immune cells especially regulatory T lympho- cytes (Tregs) [which play a critical role in regulation of proinflammation to keep  maintain  immune  balance  in ALD [need to be investigated in our further study.
Gut micobiota dysbiosis is thought to play  a  crucial role in the pathogenesis of ALD In this study, at phylum level, Bacteriodetes and Firmicutes were the most dominant in all four groups, which were paralleled with previous studies , ]. The proportion of Firmi- cutes was notably increased in alcohol feeding groups com- pared with the PF groups, which were in agreement with previous studies [Our results showed decreased Bac- teriodetesand higher Proteobacteriain alcohol intake group (AF/CO), which were responsible for gut dysbiosis as re- cently described in human and animal studies [Im- portantly, dietary FO notably reduced the proportion of Proteobacteria in chronic alcohol consumption, revealing that dietary FO may attenuate gut dysbiosis presumably by

modulating gut Proteobacteria. Exact mechanism(s) under- lying these effects remain to be determined.
At the genus level, decreased gut Porphyromonadaceae and inversely elevated Parabacteroides were found in chronic alcohol administration. Porphyromonadaceae was negatively correlated with TNF-a expression in the liver in ALD [which was paralleled with our result and the de- crease of gut Porphyromonadaceae may benefit for aggrava- tion of the liver inflammation. Elevated Parabacteroidesin AF/FO group was also involved in the prevention of hepatic inflammation in ALD as previously described Our re- sults showed that alcohol administration induced a signifi- cant reduction of Parasutterella in comparison  to  the control groups. The physiological role of Parasutterella is much less understood. Taken together, the exact role of microbiota is complicated and still largely unknown.

Conclusions
This study highlighted that dietary FO ameliorates alco- holic liver disease via anti-inflammation and modulating gut microbiota in mice, suggesting that it can potentially serve as inexpensive interventions for  the  prevention and treatment of ALD.
