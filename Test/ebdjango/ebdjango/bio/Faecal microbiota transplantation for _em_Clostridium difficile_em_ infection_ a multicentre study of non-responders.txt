Faecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridium difficile infection: a multicentre study of non-responders
Roshan Razik,*, Majdi Osman,*, Alexandra Lieberman, Jessica R Allegretti, Zain Kassam,
aecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has emerged as an effective therapy for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI), but 10e30% of patients do not respond to treat- ment.Data on this patient phenotype are scarce; in this article we describe a cohort of 135 patients in the United States who did not
respond to FMT.
We assessed consecutively collected prospective case report forms for patients who did not respond to FMT for rCDI, completed by physicians during August 2014 e November 2015 and submitted to a not-for-profit stool bank (OpenBiome,  ).Demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics were evaluated. Non-response to FMT was defined by clinical symp- toms and laboratory confirmation or endoscopic evaluation, according to standard of care. Clinicians who reported non- response were asked to complete a detailed non-response form.
Outcomes for 1845 FMT treatments during the study period were reported; the efficacy rate was 84.0%. Among the 295 non- responders, 135 non-response forms (46% response rate) were received from 74 health care facilities in 27 US states and the Netherlands. Most of these 135 non-responders were women (70%) and Caucasian (79%); the mean age was 65.9 years; 23 patients











significantly affect the efficacy of treatment.

offers insights into the heterogeneity of the current state of FMT practice. Given the broad adoption of FMT, guidelines are required for improving education, developing criteria for assessing non-response to FMT, and guiding the informed consent process, so that clear advice about risks, benefits and alternatives can be provided, including the risk of non-response.
