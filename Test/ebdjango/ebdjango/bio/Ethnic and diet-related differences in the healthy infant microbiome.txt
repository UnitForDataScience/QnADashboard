Background
The developing gastrointestinal microbiota in the first years of life is important for immune function, nutrient metabolism and protection from pathogens - Mi- crobial colonization of the infant gut proceeds through infancy and establishment of an adult-like microbiome is estimated to occur within the first 3 years Identifying factors that shape the gut microbiome is currently an ac- tive area of research and early evidence  suggests  that host genetics  and early life exposures, including

highest rates of type 2 diabetes and premature cardio- vascular disease (CVD) in the world. CVD risk factors, including adiposity, type 2 diabetes, and  dyslipidemia, are higher among South Asians compared to white Cau- casians of the same BMI []. There is preliminary evi- dence that gut microbial composition in adults and children varies by age dietary intake eth- nicity, geography  ], and adoption of western life- styles   Bacterial richness has been shown to increase with age and to be lower in residents of the United States compared with other populations Core bacterial metabolic genes varied between these popula- tions as well; however, the underlying reasons for ethnic and geographic differences in the microbiome have not been characterized. In this paper we investigate the asso- ciations of ethnicity and early life exposures with the gut microbiome among 1-year-old infants born and living in Canada while accounting for a diverse set of covariates that represent dietary differences as well as other expo- sures throughout infancy. This study explores the effect  of ethnicity separately from region and provides a pre- liminary look at effects of ethnicity on the gut micro- biota in early life.

Methods
Cohorts
Participants from two prospective Canadian birth co- horts were included in this gut microbiome  substudy.  The Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development study (CHILD) enrolled 3624 mainly white Caucasian mother-child pairs and most fathers from four Canadian centers (Vancouver, BC; Edmonton, AB; Winnipeg/ Winkler-Morden, MB; and Toronto, ON) to investigate the root causes of allergy and asthma, including genetic and environmental triggers, and the ways in which they interact - In this analysis, ethnicity refers to groups of people who have certain racial, cultural, reli- gious, or other traits in common,  whereas race  refers to  a person's physical characteristics, such as bone struc- ture, or skin, hair, or eye color ,  In the CHILD cohort, white Caucasian ancestry was confirmed by par- ticipants' response to the question "To which ethnic or cultural group did your parents belong?" The  South  Asian Birth Cohort (START-Canada) enrolled 1012 South Asian mother-child pairs from the Brampton and Peel Region of Ontario to investigate the influence of di- verse environmental exposures and genetics on early life adiposity, growth trajectory, and cardiometabolic factors  South Asian ethnicity was verified by the mother's self-report of her and the father's, and their parents', an- cestral origin being from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, or Bangladesh.
Harmonization   of   clinical   data   across   cohorts was
done   by   extracting   them   with   the   same definitions,


where possible. When questions were not identical, we worked to extract the  data from each cohort in such a way as to satisfy the same definition. Gestational dia- betes mellitus was defined as having diabetes on  the birth chart but no diabetes prior to pregnancy. A child was considered to have had formula in the first year if formula use was recorded at any time in the first year (from several questionnaires). In both cohorts, timing of infant weighing at 1 year was typically performed on the same day as 1-year stool collection  (r2 > 0.93; median = 0 days; 95% confidence interval 0 to 2 days).
In this gut microbiome substudy, 1-year fecal samples from 173 white Caucasian infants in CHILD and 182 South Asian infants in START were used for the main analysis. An additional 77 samples from the CHILD co- hort, from infants who are not white Caucasian,  were used to explore trends found in the main analysis. For both cohorts, the collection of 1-year fecal samples was scheduled with the mother in advance. Stool collection was taken from a regular diaper in START and a spe- cially lined diaper in CHILD  Mothers were instructed to record the time and date of the stool sam- ple and place it in a  sterile bag in the refrigerator for  their scheduled appointment with the research nurse. Upon arrival, the nurse used depyrogenized  stainless steel spatulas to divide the sample between four pre- labeled cryovials. The cryovials were then transported to the lab in a cooler, weighed, and stored at -80 degC or li- quid nitrogen. START samples were stored at 4 degC for 2-4 h prior to freezing whereas CHILD samples were stored at 4 degC for an average of 14 +- 12 h.

DNA extraction, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and analysis DNA was extracted with a custom DNA extraction proto- col described in []. Briefly, 100-200 mg of stool was added to 2.8 mm and 0.1 mm glass beads (MoBio Labora- tories Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) along with  800  ml  of 200 mM sodium phosphate monobasic (pH 8) and 100 ml guanidinium thiocyanate EDTA N-lauroylsarkosine buffer (50.8 mM guanidine thiocyanate, 100 mM ethylenedi- aminetetraacetic acid, and 34 mM N-lauroylsarcosine). These were then homogenized in a PowerLyzer 24 Bench Top Homogenizer (MoBio Laboratories Inc.) for 3 min at 3000 RPM. Next, two enzymatic lysis steps were per- formed. First, the sample was incubated with 50 ml  of 100 mg/ml lysozyme, 500 U mutanolysin, and 10 ml of  10 mg/ml RNase for 1 h at 37 degC. Next, the sample was in- cubated with 25 ml 25% sodium dodecyl sulphate, 25 ml of 20 mg/ml Proteinase K, and 62.5 ml of 5 M NaCl at 65 degC for 1 h. Next, debris was pelleted in a tabletop centrifuge at maximum speed for 5 min and the supernatant added   to 900 ml of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). The sample was then vortexed and centrifuged at max- imum speed in a tabletop centrifuge for 10 min. The






aqueous phase was removed and the sample run through the Clean and Concentrator-25 column (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) according to kit directions except for elution, which was done with 50 ml of ultrapure water and allowed to sit for 5 min before elution. The DNA was quantified using a Nanodrop 2000c Spectrophotometer []. Amplification of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene v3 re- gion (150 bp) tags was performed as previously described
[] with the  following  changes:  5  pmol  of  primer,  200 mM of each dNTP, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 ml of 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1.25 U Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were used in a 50 ml reaction volume. The PCR program used was as follows: 94 degC for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 degC for 30 s, 50 degC for 30 s, and 72 degC for 30 s, then a final extension step at 72 degC for 10 min. DNA extraction and PCR ampli- fication of 16S rRNA gene v3 libraries were found to be reproducible using a set of five samples from each cohort (total of ten samples) that were extracted in triplicate (29 extractions since one extraction failed) and a subset of three extractions from each cohort amplified in triplicate for a total of 41 datasets (Additional file Figure S1).
Illumina libraries were sequenced in the McMaster Genomics Facility with 250-bp sequencing in the for- ward and reverse directions on the Illumina MiSeq in- strument. Custom, in-house Perl scripts were used to process Illumina sequences as previously described  Briefly, after sequence trimming and alignment, oper- ational taxonomic units (OTU) were clustered using AbundantOTU+  with a threshold of 97%. Chimera checking was not done since we have shown that ampli- fication of the short V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene leads to very few genuine chimeric sequences Tax- onomy for the representative sequence  of  each  OTU was assigned using the Ribosomal Database Project clas- sifier  with a minimum confidence cutoff of 0.8 against the Greengenes (2013 release) reference database  All OTUs classified as "Root:Other" (comprising 0.03% of the total reads sequenced) were then excluded as was one sample with <500 sequenced reads; however, singleton OTUs were not excluded. This resulted in  a total of 41.4 million reads with a minimum of 2.0 x 103, maximum of 4.3 x 105, and a median of 9.0 x 104 reads per sample.
Bacterial community richness and diversity (alpha diversity) were calculated using the estimated species richness and Shannon diversity functions with the  vegan package in R [ using OTU abundances. Dif- ferences between bacterial communities in each sample (beta diversity) were quantified using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure on relative  abundance  values  of  all bacterial genera and principal  coordinate  analysis  was also done using the vegan package or the phyloseq package [in R.


Statistical Analysis
Simple linear regression was used to determine the effect of ethnicity and breastfeeding on alpha diversity esti- mates. Permutational multivariate  analysis  of variance on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities of genus level relative abundances, done with the adonis function from the vegan package in R [ was used to examine bacterial community differences associated with ethnicity after adjustment for potential covariates of ethnicity-micro- biome associations.
Candidate covariates in the multivariable model were informed by the existing literature and assessed formally in univariable models against microbiome diversity (i.e., years mother lived in Canada, breastfeeding at time of collection, time since weaning, formula and cow's milk use in the first year, time of introduction of solid foods, infant weight gain in the first year, birth weight, infant age at stool collection, and mode of delivery, gestational diabetes, mother's antibiotic use during pregnancy and labor, and mother's vegetarian status). Next, the candi- date variables chosen above were used to separately pre- dict dissimilarities with the same method  as  above. Those with p < 0.10 were subjected to a forward stepwise procedure. We then added the most significant covari- ates into the model in order of the proportion of  vari- ance explained, and stopped when the next most significant covariate was above the 0.05 threshold.
The association between genus level abundances and ethnicity and/or breastfeeding was determined through a multivariate algorithm adjusting for significant covariates performed with the Maaslin package in R [  Briefly, covariates found to be significant (p < 0.05) pre- dictors of the microbiome (described above) were in- cluded into a multivariate boosted, additive general  linear model between covariate data and bacterial genus level abundances. P values were adjusted for multiple testing with the false discovery rate, reported as q values, and q < 0.05 was considered significant. Genera with a coefficient of variation >0.001 were included in Add- itional file Table S1.

Results
Table  shows the baseline demographic and anthropo- metric characteristics of the mothers and infants se- lected from CHILD (white Caucasians only) and START. Briefly, South Asian mothers lived in Canada for an average of 8 years versus a lifetime for white Caucasian mothers. Furthermore, South Asian mothers were youn- ger, more likely to be vegetarian (34% versus 2%, p < 0.001), and to be diagnosed with gestational diabetes during pregnancy (14% versus 4%, p < 0.001) compared to white Caucasian mothers. There were no significant differences in the rates of Caesarian section between eth- nic groups (18% in South Asian versus 15% in white

Abundance of microorganisms within all samples
The v3 region of 16S rRNA genes was profiled from 355 participant stool samples collected at 1 year of age, 173 white Caucasians from the CHILD cohort and 182 from the START cohort. The range of alpha diversity esti- mates for each ethnicity separated by current breastfeed- ing at the time of sampling is illustrated in Fig. Using simple linear regression, species richness estimates were found to be significantly affected by ethnicity after taking into account breastfeeding at time of collection  (p < 0.05). Shannon diversity was significantly affected by






ethnicity, taking into account breastfeeding at time of collection (p < 0.001), and likewise breastfeeding at time of collection within each ethnicity significantly affected Shannon diversity (p < 0.05). Further, when START sam- ples, all collected within the Brampton/Peel region of Ontario Canada, were compared with each study center within the CHILD cohort (Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, and Winnipeg/Winkler-Morden) only Winnipeg/Winkler- Morden, MB had significantly lower species richness esti- mates (p < 0.05; Additional file  Figure S2). Although there was variability in Shannon diversity estimates across sample sites for CHILD, all sites were found to have signifi- cantly lower diversity than the START samples (p < 0.05; Additional file Figure S2), while accounting for current breastfeeding. By including sample sites into the regression model the effect of current breastfeeding on Shannon di- versity was no longer significant (p = 0.054).
Differences in the relative abundance of the dominant bacterial genera are presented in Additional file Figure S3, broken down by ethnic group and breastfeeding status. Heterogeneity of samples can be seen in Additional file  Figure S3 as well as differences in genus level microbobial profiles between ethnic groups and breastfeeding status, differences that are explored in detail below.
Principal coordinate analysis of Bray-Curtis dissimilar- ities illustrates between-community differences in sam- ples from white Caucasians and South Asian infants. Variation in the gut microbiome across geography has been observed in studies involving adults []; however, in our study the effect of ethnicity was larger than the effect of geographic location (Fig. shown as the separ- ation of the centroid for samples from  South  Asians  from the centroids of samples from white Caucasians from all study centers. Also evident from the principal coordinate analysis, breastfeeding at time of collection affected the gut microbial profiles, although when strati- fied by currently breastfed and not currently breastfed infants, the strong effect of ethnicity persisted (Fig.  Several studies have found the infant gut microbiome to vary between infants born by Caesarean section and  those born vaginally with the effect diminishing  with  age. Here, delivery method was not found to be a signifi- cant predictor of the structure of the gut microbiome in 1-year-old infants (Additional file Figure S4). This may be because differences were no longer strong enough to be detected or because members of the phylum Bacteroi- detes, often missing from the gut microbiome in Caesar- ean section delivered infants, were not abundant in our vaginally born infants (Additional file Figure S2).

Association between ethnicity, milk diet, and solid food diet
In addition to ethnicity, 13 potential covariates were also associated with the microbiome in univariable regression




















analysis. These included mother's years living in Canada, infant age, breastfeeding status at time  of  collection, time since weaning, vegetarian status, timing of intro- duction of solid foods, birth weight, infant weight gain    in the first year, antibiotics during pregnancy, antibiotics during labor, formula use in the first year, formula use at collection, and cow's milk in the first year (all p < 0.10; Table We entered this set of covariates into a forward stepwise regression model to determine which factors remained significant and independently influenced the  gut microbiome. Only ethnicity (p < 0.001), breastfeeding status (p < 0.001), infant age at stool collection (p < 0.01), and weight gain in the first year (p < 0.01) remained in- dependently associated with the gut microbiome as a whole.
There was no statistically significant multiplicative interaction between ethnicity and breastfeeding (p = 0.23). Nevertheless, we acknowledge that such tests may be underpowered, and thus the results were also strati- fied by ethnicity and breastfeeding status in order to examine trends. Forward stepwise regression was con- ducted within white Caucasians and separately within South Asians (Table  This revealed that breastfeeding (p < 0.01) and infant age (p < 0.05) were independently associated with differences in the microbiome within each ethnic group, while antibiotic use during labor (p < 0.05) and weight gain in the first year (p < 0.05) remained independently associated with differences  in  the microbiome only in white Caucasians. Forward step- wise regression was also conducted separately within in- fants breastfed and not breastfed at the time of collection (Table  which indicated that ethnicity (p < 0.01) and the infant age (p < 0.05) remained independ- ently associated with differences in the  gut microbiome in both groups.








































Differentially abundant genera within each group Difference in the relative abundance of the dominant bacterial genera is presented as a taxa bar chart in Add- itional file  Figure S2, broken down by ethnic group  and breastfeeding status. The relative abundance of indi- vidual bacterial genera was assessed for association with ethnicity and breastfeeding while accounting for infant age and weight gain in the first year. These covariates, which had survived the stepwise regression on the entire community, were included in the multivariate algorithm in order to strike a balance between  overfitting  the model and identifying the most comprehensive list of predictors. Taxa significantly associated with ethnicity, breastfeeding at time of collection, infant weight gain in the first year, and infant age (q value <0.05) are listed in Additional file  Table S1 and their abundance is illus- trated in Fig. 
South Asians had higher abundances of several genera within the Actinobacteria (Bifidobacterium, Collinsella, Actinomyces, Atopobium) and of three unclassified gen- era compared to white Caucasians. Genera within the

phylum Firmicutes within two distinct taxonomic groups were associated with ethnicity. Genera such as Strepto- coccus, Enterococcus, and Lactobacillus (class Bacilli, order Lactobacillales) were more abundant within South Asians whereas genera such as Blautia, Pseudobutyrivi- brio, Ruminococcus, and Oscillospira (order Clostri- diales) were more abundant in white Caucasians. The most differentially abundant genus were unclassified members of the Lachnospiraceae which were higher in white Caucasians. In order to investigate whether these differences were specific to each cohort or were indica- tive of true ethnic differences, five genera significantly associated with either white Caucasians or South Asians were plotted among the small number of South Asians recruited within the CHILD cohort (n = 6 that were not used for the previous microbiome analysis). Despite the small number available, the same trends were  seen for  the five genera plotted (Additional file Figure S5).
Not surprisingly,  breastfeeding  status  at the   time  of sample collection was strongly associated with the abundance of the genera Bifdobacterium (phylum

Actinobacteria;  Fig.  ).  Several  genera  within  the phylum Firmicutes were associated with  breastfeeding  at the time of collection; some were more abundant (Veillo- nella, Megasphaera, and Dialister) and others were less abundant (Blautia, unclassified Lachospiraceae, Clostrid- ium, Ruminococcus, Coprobacillus, Lactococcus, as well as several unclassified genera within the Clostridiales and Erysipelotrichales).

Discussion
Our results demonstrate that the gut microbiome of in- fants is influenced by ethnicity, infant age, weight gain, and breastfeeding. The gut microbiome has been pro- posed to influence the progression of chronic  diseases and has been associated with adverse health outcomes  Development of the microbiome within the first years of life may influence long-term health, and can be affected by perinatal, genetic, and dietary factors, includ- ing solid foods and milk diet.
The distribution of a number of maternal and infant parameters differed between white Caucasian and South Asians (i.e., vegetarian status, gestational diabetes melli- tus prevalence, timing of introduction of solid foods, antibiotic use during pregnancy, mode of delivery, etc.) and thus seemed likely candidates to explain the micro- biome differences by ethnicity. However, when these var- iables were added as independent predictors of the gut microbiome composition in the multivariable model, none except breastfeeding status at the time of sampling,



infant age, and weight gain in the first year improved the fit of the model (ethnicity R2 = 0.084 versus R2 = 0.082 with all additional variables; breastfeeding status R2 =
0.040 versus R2 = 0.032 with all additional variables). This suggests that these variables were largely captured by the higher order variables of interest, i.e.,  ethnicity and breastfeeding. Next, after taking into account these significant predictors (breastfeeding status, infant age at 1-year stool, and weight gain in the first year of life) we found that groups of bacterial genera which are phylo- genetically distinct (i.e., within the order Lactobacillales versus Clostridales) were present at different abundances within each ethnic group. This suggests that different metabolic strategies are at work within the gut micro- biome of South Asian and white Caucasian infants. Add- itionally, these bacterial taxa are good candidates to predict diet-related influences on the microbiome, mi- crobial influences on host metabolism, and bacterial stimulation of the host immune system ].
Several members of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB), spe- cifically Bifidobacterium, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus, were more abundant within South Asians after taking into account breastfeeding status at the time of collection, infant age, and weight gain in the first year. LAB break down mainly carbohydrates that are not absorbed by the host to produce  acetate  and  lactate, both of which are used as energy sources by other mi- crobial groups Also the abundance of members of the Atopobium cluster of Actinobacteria (i.e., genera

such as Collinsella and Atopobium) was higher in South Asians. This group of bacteria are saccharolytic (i.e., they break down small sugars) and have been seen to de- crease in abundance in the microbiome of individuals  with a diet rich in whole grains These genera have also been associated with higher levels of low-density lipoprotein in humans  and, along with other mem- bers of the Actinobacteria, have been associated with  high hepatic levels of triglycerides and low hepatic levels of glycogen and glucose in mice  It is of interest to note that these observations are based on v3 16S rRNA gene data. Several studies of the infant gut microbiome,

which employ amplification and sequencing of other variable regions of the same gene often report very low levels of Actinobacteria  ,  Members of this phylum, such as the Bifidobacteria, have been shown to dominate the infant gut microbiome [suggest- ing a possible primer bias against this group.
In contrast, white Caucasians showed higher abundances of members of the Firmicutes from the order Clostridiales, which have been shown to be increased in response to di- ets rich in animal protein [] and high in fat [3]. Prod- ucts of bacterial fermentation of acetate and lactate, mentioned above, as well as non-digestible fiber and

oligosaccharides by members of the Clostridiales seen here (Ruminococcus, Lachnospiraceae, and Oscillospira) include short chain fatty acids like butyrate, which is used by host cells as an energy source and can signal increased barrier function []. Though also proposed to be chemoprotec- tive, the relationship between luminal butyrate exposure and colorectal cancer in humans has been examined only indirectly in case-control studies [4]. Nevertheless, these findings suggest different metabolic processes and immune stimuli at work within the South Asian and white Cauca- sian infant gastrointestinal tract, some of which may be ex- plained by their heterogeneous diets.


When switching from a milk-based diet  to  a  solid food diet, prior studies have shown a decrease in the abundance of  Bifidobacterium along  with an  increase in members of  the Firmicutes  (such  as  Clostridium sp.) and Bacteroidetes ,    One study suggests  that it is the cessation  of breastfeeding  that  is  re- quired for maturation of the gut  microbiota  to  occur  with a decrease in Bifidobacterium and an increase in members of the Clostridiales only occurring after weaning [ As expected, after adjustment for  ethni-  city, infant age, and weight gain in the first year, Bifi- dobacterium and Lactobacillus were significantly












































associated with breastfeeding. Additionally, an in- crease in the abundance of several genera within the phylum Firmicutes were associated with not being breastfed at the time of sampling.
Bifidobacteria, along with the LAB, are known to be abundant members of the microbiome of breastfeeding infants [ whereas genera within the order Clostri- diales are known to be more abundant within the gut of adults [ Here bacterial profiles indicative of a breast milk diet were common among South Asians even those that were not breastfeeding at the time of collection, suggesting that these infants retain more of a breastfeed- ing microbiome than do white Caucasians of the same age. The reasons for this are unclear; however, dietary


differences may be contributing. Our data show that equal proportions of infants in both groups were breast- fed in the first year but does not capture breastfeeding frequency. It also shows that there was a much higher rate of formula use and an earlier introduction to solid food within South Asian than within white Caucasian in- fants. Because self-reported vegetarianism was more fre- quent in South Asians, it is possible that meat consumption hastens, or non-meat diets delay, changes induced within the infant gut microbiome during the switch to a solid food diet. It is important to note, how- ever, that to our knowledge an analysis of  the  adult South  Asian microbiome has not been reported, nor has   a description of the maturation of the South Asian infant microbiome toward an adult-like composition; thus, our data must be interpreted within the context of the study, i.e., of South Asian infants born in Canada who consume a South Asian diet.
The underlying construct of "Ethnicity" brings together several biological and cultural factors, and it can be charac- terized using a number of different parameters (e.g., dietary habits, ancestral country of origin, etc.). In our multivariate model, ethnicity and breast feeding status remained inde- pendent and significant predictors of differences in the overall microbial communities (beta diversity), whereas vegetarian diet did not, which implies that the impact of ethnicity which incorporates  some unique  dietary patterns is not wholly explained by these dietary differences, as it also reflects other differences between the groups. After ensuring that these additional factors were potentially accounted for (i.e., years living in Canada, antibiotic use, timing of solid food introduction, etc.) we observed that breastfeeding, infant age, and weight gain in the first year significantly influenced the infant gut microbiome.
Strengths of our study include its relatively large size of nearly 200 infants from each of two different ethnic groups who have diverse dietary intakes; the availability of stool samples collected at similar times using similar  methods; the high quality deep sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene for bacterial identification; a reliability analysis to demonstrate reproducibility of our methods; and detailed measurement of maternal and infant covariates. Limitations include in- complete data on maternal weight gain during and prior to pregnancy, which limits our ability to assess the influence of this important covariate on the infant gut microbiome; ethnicity in this study refers to the group a person self- identifies with and reflects a mix of cultural factors, including language, diet, religion, and ancestry--thus, ethnicity is a multidimensional construct which includes some within-group heterogeneity, and differences attribut- able to ethnicity may reflect a broad range of factors which are not purely biological; and the lack of a direct measure   of infant dietary intake beyond feeding type at the time of stool collection.





Conclusions
The infant gut microbiome is influenced  by  ethnicity and breastfeeding in the first year of life. Ethnic differ- ences in the gut microbiome may reflect maternal/infant dietary differences and whether these differences are as- sociated with future cardiometabolic outcomes can only be determined after prospective follow-up.
