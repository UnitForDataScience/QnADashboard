Food and microbiota in the FDA regulatory framework
How should microbiota-directed foods be regulated?

microbiota in ways that increase microbial production of a nutrient necessary for a healthy state, would the MDF be consid- ered a food? One way of distinguishing a conventional food from an MDF is that the former is not designed to specifically alter the properties of the microbiota, whereas the latter is intentionally formulated with this goal in mind. In practice, ingredients that target the microbiota may be present in, or deliberately added to, existing prod- ucts [e.g., human milk oligosaccharides in infant formula (12)].
The distinction between conventional food and an MDF may be inconsequential from a regulatory perspective if the use of the MDF satisfies criteria for being deemed Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) and claims fall within the scope allowable for food. Note that it is not the substance itself that underlies GRAS designation but rather its manner of use; moreover, there is no

ew understanding of how our gut microbial communities (microbiota) transform dietary ingredients into metabolic products that affect hu- man biology is altering our defini- tions of the nutritional value of foods
(1, 2). We are coming to appreciate how much formation of the gut microbiota dur- ing early postnatal life and the traits en- coded by its several million microbial genes (microbiome) are important determinants of healthy growth and of our metabolic, physiologic, immune, and perhaps neuro- logic phenotypes (3, 4). These advances are spawning efforts to develop foods that pro- mote healthy microbiota development dur- ing early postnatal life, prevent the loss of microbial diversity associated with Western diets, and repair abnormalities associated with various disease states (5-8). But given the mechanisms by which such microbiota- directed foods (MDFs) may achieve their desired effects, the existing U.S. regulatory framework presents challenges in determin- ing how MDFs should be classified. How these challenges are addressed will affect innovation incentives, product quality, con- sumer access, and public health. Although

approaches to regulation vary among coun- tries (9), we focus on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) because of its global influence and because the products it regulates are often widely distributed.
It has been more than 20 years since the last major revision of regulatory definitions for food ingredients in the United States. When the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 was signed into law, knowledge of the role of the gut microbiota in health and disease was limited. Growing appreciation of how the microbiota generates biomolecules that are not produced by any of our human cell lineages and that affect our health status is forcing us to evolve our con- cept of essential nutrients to include some of these microbial products (10, 11). A micro- biota that cannot generate these products in adequate quantities may lead to disease and is thus a target for reconfiguration by MDFs, which can be defined as foods designed to al- ter properties of a microbiota. An MDF could alter existing members of the consumer's mi- crobiota in a deliberate manner to affect the community's functional properties, and/or it may provide a substrate that is transformed by the microbiota to products necessary for a healthy state.

POTENTIAL CLASSIFICATIONS
If an MDF is designed primarily to provide nutritive value, a key question is whether such nutritive value has to be provided di- rectly by the MDF for it to be classified as a "conventional food" by the FDA (i.e., sub- stances ingested primarily for their taste, aroma, or nutritive value). For example, if the MDF affects targeted members of the

definitive list of substances established as GRAS under conditions of intended use. To establish GRAS status, qualified food-safety experts would have to consider the effects of the MDF, its constituents, and the prod- ucts of its microbial biotransformation. If an MDF is composed of ingredients with GRAS status, it could be classified as a con- ventional food. If any components do not have GRAS status, they cannot be added to conventional food without petitioning the FDA for approval as a new food additive. This requires extensive safety testing (13).
If an MDF were classified as a "dietary supplement," it would be possible to make certain claims related to its nutrient con- tent and its effects on health or the struc- ture and function of the body but not claims regarding the treatment, prevention, or di- agnosis of a disease. However, if an MDF contains a substance not  normally  found in food or one that has not been reviewed by the FDA as a new ingredient under a New Dietary Ingredient (NDI) Notification, its classification as a dietary supplement would likely be precluded (14).
A "medical food" is designed for dietary management of a disease or condition with "distinctive nutritional requirements" (e.g., for management of inborn errors of me- tabolism, such as phenylketonuria). If an MDF is designed for a condition where in- sufficiency of a product of a microbiota--or chemicals generated by host cell metabolism of that product--is recognized to be causally related to the condition, then that product might be considered an "essential nutrient" in the context of that condition. An MDF that promotes microbial production of the

essential nutrient may meet the regulatory definition of a medical food if the condition cannot be addressed through modification of a normal diet alone (or one that includes a dietary supplement). Key questions in- clude whether the condition is recognized by the scientific community as having dis- tinctive nutritional requirements and the extent to which the definition of essential nutrient is expanded to include products of microbial metabolism.
Because dietary practices are known to al- ter microbiota configuration and metabolic output [e.g., (1, 8, 15)], classification of an MDF as a "drug" would seemingly require specific claims that it mediates reconfigura- tion to a state known to cure, mitigate, or prevent a disease and that the MDF not be classified as a food. Classification as a drug would, among other implications, entail rigorous evaluation of safety, efficacy, and Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls un- der an Investigational New Drug application. If a consensus arises in the scientific commu- nity that the FDA and lawmakers in Congress should define the gut microbiota as a human organ from a regulatory perspective, the question will arise as to whether a claim that a MDF promotes reconfiguration of commu- nity structure or function might lead to its classification as a drug.

CLAIMING HEALTH BENEFITS
MDFs may have specific health benefits beyond the more generic claims permitted by the FDA for foods (e.g., "Three grams of soluble fiber from oatmeal consumed daily in a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease, ..."). "Structure-function claims" are allowed for dietary supplements (e.g., "calcium builds strong bones") (16). Note that conventional foods may not bear disease claims, explicit or implied. Classification of an MDF as a medical food would provide a route for making claims for dietary management of  a condition without premarket approval as  a drug. However, the FDA requires medi- cal foods to meet specific criteria related to their formulation, processing, and the medi- cal conditions for which distinctive nutrient requirements have been determined (17).
One approach for regulating MDFs that provide specific health benefits would be to create a monograph analogous to that used for over-the-counter drugs, as has been sug- gested for probiotics (18). This approach would allow MDF manufacturers to make health and/or disease claims that have been substantiated without going through what is, to many, a prohibitively costly drug de- velopment process, while providing the public with trustworthy products. An MDF monograph would include descriptions of

acceptable doses of active ingredients and allowable product claims and labeling, based on expert panel recommendations. "Acceptable dose" would include consider- ations of safety and efficacy in target popu- lations. Although marketing a new product under the over-the-counter drug mono- graph system can be complex, if an MDF is composed entirely of existing foodstuffs, an abbreviated review process could focus on defining allowable claims and labeling.

FOOD AND THE MICROBIOTA
To what extent will scientific advances in microbiota research affect public attitudes and governmental regulation? How will regulatory decisions, in turn, affect scientific progress and society? MDFs offer research opportunities to (i) delineate how microbial


"Classification schemes that are ultimately adopted will likely have broad societal implications for...products that target the microbiota."
communities affect our biology, (ii) deter- mine the extent to which it is possible to re- shape community functions through dietary interventions, (iii) characterize the generaliz- ability of these effects and their short- and long-term safety and efficacy, and (iv) catalyze efforts to identify bioactive natural products derived from gut microbiota.  Development of MDFs will likely help change concepts and definitions of nutritional requirements, nutritional benefits, and food safety. They will also likely raise questions about what effect a food has (or should have) on the mi- crobiota, and what constitutes a "healthy" food. Addressing these issues will necessitate well-controlled human studies with measure- ments of microbiota and host parameters. Regulatory classification of MDFs used in these trials will influence their development plans and future uses.
A revolution has already started, exploit- ing advances in analytic methods, such as mass spectrometry, to characterize food in- gredients at an unprecedented level of mo- lecular resolution. For example, efforts are under way to define structures of complex polysaccharides present in different crops and how they vary as a function of different cultivars and the processes used to incorpo- rate them into various foods. This capacity to define what we eat provides a new di- mension to studies of the anthropology of food and promises to change how we de- fine "nutritive value." We can gain greater

understanding of how microbial commu- nities transform foods into products and which of these products are important con- tributors to "normal" (healthy) physiologic functions. The challenge is to determine which of these microbiota-derived products are common features of a healthy human being; how the term "common" is related to age, gender, and anthropologic features of a population; what concentration range is as- sociated with a healthy state; and whether deficiency of one or more of these products is causally linked to an unhealthy state. This knowledge could not only expand how we define a healthy food but would also en- able design of MDFs and provide biomark- ers to establish their efficacy.
The number of products claiming to pro- vide benefits through effects on the micro- biota is growing rapidly. Consumers and health care professionals need an evidence- based framework to inform decisions. Wider consideration should be given to how poli- cies that address these issues can be applied and harmonized across national boundaries. Classification schemes that are ultimately adopted will likely have broad societal im- plications for testing, labeling, branding, and advertising of products that target the microbiota. In addition, they could affect ef- forts designed to develop future nutritious foods "from the inside out," based on knowl- edge of the effects of these foods on consum- ers' gut microbial communities. j
