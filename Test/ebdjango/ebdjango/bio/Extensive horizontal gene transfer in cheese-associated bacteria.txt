Abstract Acquisition of genes through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) allows microbes to rapidly gain new capabilities and adapt to new or changing environments. Identifying widespread HGT regions within multispecies microbiomes can pinpoint the molecular mechanisms that play key roles in microbiome assembly. We sought to identify horizontally transferred genes within a model microbiome, the cheese rind. Comparing 31 newly sequenced and 134 previously sequenced bacterial isolates from cheese rinds, we identified over 200  putative  horizontally  transferred genomic regions containing 4733 protein coding genes. The largest of these regions are enriched    for genes involved in siderophore acquisition, and are widely distributed in cheese rinds in both Europe and the US. These results suggest that HGT is prevalent in cheese rind microbiomes, and that identification of genes that are frequently transferred in a particular environment may provide insight into the selective forces shaping microbial communities.

Introduction
Great strides have been made in characterizing the composition of microbiomes, and in understand- ing their importance in the ecology of natural systems, in agriculture and in human health. However, despite these advances, the forces that shape the diversity, structure, and function of microbiomes remain poorly understood (). Investigating these underlying mechanisms in situ     is difficult, as observational and sequenced-based analysis rarely enables causal conclusions (). Replicating microbial communities in vitro is also an enormous challenge, because of high levels of diversity and the difficulties in establishing pure cultures of most bacterial species. These obstacles significantly hamper our ability to move from observations of microbial diversity to the molecular mechanisms shaping key processes such as species interactions and micro- bial evolution.
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a major force in microbial evolution and can lead to the whole- sale acquisition of novel functions. In some cases, these novel functions can have significant adaptive consequences, such as in the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (). HGT also allows rapid adaptation to new niches (), as  ecologically relevant genes may be acquired by species not previously adapted to a particular niche (; ). The movement of microbes to new environments has been shown to increase both the rate and impact of HGT, and HGT is most frequent for genes under positive selec- tion (). In moving to a new environment, microbes can face novel abiotic condi- tions (temperature, moisture, salinity, pH, and nutrients) and novel biotic  challenges  and opportunities resulting from the presence of microbial neighbors.
Evaluating HGT within the context of microbial communities could provide new insights concern- ing the extent, mechanisms, and ecological impact of this important process. Advances in genome



eLife digest From the depths of the ocean to the lining of the human gut, almost every environment on Earth is home to a unique community of microorganisms referred to as a microbiome. Within these communities, unrelated microorganisms can exchange genetic information through a process known as horizontal gene transfer. For example, genes linked to antibiotic resistance are often transferred between different microorganisms, which can create increasingly drug resistant microbes and has important implications for human health.
Horizontal gene transfer has been studied for almost 100 years, but examining it directly is challenging because, almost by definition, it requires studying a community of microbes rather than one microbe in isolation. As such, researchers are looking for simple models of microbial  communities that can be easily manipulated in experiments.
Bonham et al. have now turned to the outer surface of cheese, also known as cheese rind, to better understand horizontal gene transfer. As a model system, the cheese rind microbiome is relatively simple to work with because cheese rind is easy to replicate in the laboratory, and the microbes growing on cheese can be grown on their own or in combinations with other microbes. By comparing the genetic material of 165 cheese-associated bacteria to one another, Bonham et al. identified over 4,000 genes that were shared between the bacteria, including several large clusters   of genes that were shared by many species.
Many of the identified genes (about 23% to be precise) appear to help  the  microorganisms acquire nutrients that are known to be in short supply on the surface of cheese surface, including  iron. Bacteria typically use specialized molecules called siderophores to scavenge for iron and   uptake systems to carry the iron-bound siderophore back into the cell. Notably, only the genes associated with the uptake systems were found in some of the shared gene clusters. This finding suggests that horizontal gene transfer has allowed some microbes to "cheat" and take up iron-   bound siderophores without expending energy to produce the siderophores themselves.
Using the cheese rind microbiome as a model system, it becomes possible to explore how horizontal gene transfer works in more detail than before.  A  better understanding  of this  process can then be applied to other important microbiomes, including those where genes conferring  antibiotic resistance are commonly exchanged.



sequencing have begun to provide a glimpse into HGT within environmentally, medically and eco- nomically important microbiomes (; ). For example, exten- sive  gene  sharing  has  been  observed  throughout  the  commensal  human  microbiome,   including  sharing  of  genes  that  enable  nutrient  acquisition  from  novel  food  sources  (; ), and pathogenicity islands and antibiotic resistance genes in pathogenic microbes (; ;   ). There is evidence of extensive HGT in other natural habitats, such as soil ( ;  )  and  aquatic  environments  (;  ). Although these studies offer valuable insights into the frequency  and poten-  tial impact of genes that can be transferred in microbial communities, the complexity of these sys- tems makes difficult any further examination of the effects of these HGT events on their evolution   and ecology.
The microbial communities of fermented foods experience strong selection as a result of growing  in novel, human-made environments. Previous work has demonstrated that HGT can be a major driver of adaptation in food systems and other human-managed environments (; ). Prior analysis of microbial species from cheese has revealed several instances of HGT in this environment. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) such as Lactobacillus and Lactococcus, which are used in the initial fermentation of milk, are known to harbor antibiotic resistance genes and may be reservoirs for transfer to pathogenic enterococci (; ) and other pathogenic microbes. Other food-associated bacteria may also contribute to antibiotic resis- tance  gene  transfer  (;  ;  ).  In  yogurt, another dairy ferment using LAB, HGT of metabolic genes has been observed between

protocooperative species L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus (; ). Sequencing of Penicillium species isolated from the cheesemaking environment identified HGT of large genomic islands between these key fungal inhabitants of cheese (; ; ).
During the aging of traditional styles of cheese in caves or aging rooms, bacteria and fungi form     a multi-species biofilm called the rind (). We have previously shown that these communities can be used to examine community-based processes, such as succession and interspecies interactions,  within  an  experimentally  tractable  system  (;  ). Given that biofilms such as these are densely populated, and microbes in cheese rinds are under strong selection to obtain limited nutrients (e.g.  free amino acids,  iron) as well as tolerate cell stress (), we predicted that HGT might be widespread in cheese rind microbiomes and therefore might provide a useful experimental model for HGT within microbial communities.
We sought to determine the diversity, distribution, and functional content of HGT in bacterial species isolated from cheese rinds. Specifically, we predicted that (1) HGT would be widespread, (2) HGT genes would be enriched for functions related to survival in cheese environment, and (3) there would be uneven distribution of HGT events across taxa. We analyzed the genomes of newly iso- lated and sequenced cheese-associated bacterial species (31 genomes) and those available in public databases (134 additional genomes). We present data which suggest that there is extensive HGT in cheese-associated bacteria. The regions of DNA identified appear to encode a number of functions which would be expected to provide adaptive advantages within the cheese environment. In particu- lar, we identified three large multi-gene islands that are shared within multiple Actinobacteria, Pro- teobacteria, and Firmicutes species. These genomic regions are not related, but appear to have analogous functions involving iron acquisition, and are widely distributed in geographically distant cheeses. This work provides foundational knowledge in an experimentally tractable system in which future work could help to provide insight into the role of HGT within microbiomes.


Results
Identification of putative horizontally transferred regions
To establish a diverse database of cheese-associated bacterial genomes, we isolated species from cheese samples collected as part of previous work (). A total of 31 isolates, repre- senting four bacterial phyla and 11 genera, were selected for genome sequencing using Illumina and PacBio (). Recently, a large collection of cheese-associated bacterial genomes were sequenced (), allowing inclusion of additional genomes in our analysis.    Our isolates were from cheeses produced in the United States, Spain, Italy, and France, while the Almeida et al. collection was almost exclusively from France. We also included genomes from the NCBI reference sequence (RefSeq) database that are associated with cheese, for a total of 165 bac- terial genomes.
We next developed a computational pipeline for identification of putative horizontally transferred genes, adapted from work on the human microbiome (). We built a central BLAST database containing all ORFs from all cheese-associated genomes. For each gene in each genome, we performed BLAST against this database, and compiled a list of hits (  , Materials and methods). For each hit, we examined the length and  percent  identity of aligned regions. Closely related species will have many nearly identical genes as a result of vertical inheritance. To avoid capturing these genes in our analysis, we determined the pairwise average nucleotide identity (ANI) between species within  the  same  genus  (;  ). ANI provides a measure of the overall similarity of two genomes. We tested varying thresholds for length and ANI to examine the effects of these parame- ters on the results (). Higher maximum ANI cutoffs and shorter lengths are  more likely to yield false positives, as closely related species are more likely to share short stretches of high nucleotide identity. At the same time, a lower maximum ANI cutoff may exclude legitimate HGT events, especially considering that closely related species are also more likely to engage in HGT. Based on our most conservative gene identity parameters (minimum 99% identity over 500 nucleotides), we identified at least one putative horizontally transferred gene in 130/165

(78.8%) cheese-associated species in the analysis, for a total of 4733 genes (, ). Because this analysis depends on the species included for comparison, this list of HGT is almost certainly an underestimate.
As multiple genes can be transferred in a single HGT event, we next assembled the putative HGT genes into groups based on genomic proximity. Individual coding sequences (CDS) for each species were grouped into islands if they were found within 5000 nucleotides of one another on the same contig. These islands were then clustered with islands in other species that shared at least one CDS. The 4733 genes were clustered into 264 individual groups (, ). Mobile elements such as transposons complicate our method of group clustering, as non-contiguous islands may be grouped together if they share a common transposon. Indeed, this appears to have occurred with Group 1, which contains genes from several disparate genomic regions. In other cases, a single species may have genes in a single group spread across multiple contigs ( ), but this may accurately represent a single HGT event.
Most HGT groups identified (231, 87.5%) contain only members of the same phylum, or even a
single genus (183 or 69%, ). This supports previous studies which suggest   that HGT is most prevalent among closely related species (). However, we uncovered several notable exceptions. For example, Alkaibacterium kapii FAM208.38, a Firmicute, has a substantial (~8 kb) fraction of Group 1, which is predominantly found in Actinobacteria species. Groups 2 and 3 each have hits found  in three different  phyla (although both are  predominantly  found in Actinobacteria).

Functions encoded in HGT regions
HGT can enable rapid evolution of microbes entering a new environment, with genes that are under positive selection observed more frequently (). Identifying the func- tions of genes that are frequently transferred could help to identify the selective forces  that are     most important for adapting to the cheese rind environment. Across all of the genes identified in      our analysis, the most abundant gene functions are transposases, conjugal transfer genes, phage- related proteins, and other mobile elements (631/4733 or 13% of all protein coding sequences). A third (86/264 or 32.6%) of all HGT groups contain mobile elements. These genetic  elements  are likely involved either directly or indirectly in mobilization and transfer of DNA.
To determine whether gene functions other than mobile elements are enriched in identified HGT regions, we used BlastKOALA () to assign KEGG functional  annotations  (, ). In approximately half (53%) of the genes, KEGG annotations could not be assigned. Of the KEGG-annotated genes, the most frequent module (281/ 2264 or 11%) was 'metal ion, iron siderophore and vitamin B12 transport systems'. Five of the          10 largest HGT groups as measured by total number of genes (Groups 1, 2, 3, 7 and 8) contained siderophore transport systems (K02013-K02016). Low availability of iron in cheese is known to limit the growth of several bacterial species (, ). Previous work has also shown that genes involved in iron acquisition are present in higher numbers in cheese-associated species compared with closely related species from other environments (;  ).
Many other horizontally transferred genes (267/2264 or 12% of KEGG-annotated genes) are also
involved in transport of nutrients relevant for growth in the cheese environment. Lactate is an abun- dant  carbon  source  in  freshly  made  cheese,  as  the  initial  stages  of  cheesemaking  involve

fermentation of lactose to lactate by lactic acid bacteria (). We observed a large number of genes (63/2264 or 2.8% of KEGG-annotated genes) involved in lactate import (lac- tate permease - K03303) or lactate metabolism. Lactate dehydrogenase (K00101), which reduces lac- tate to pyruvate, represented nearly 1% of all horizontally transferred protein coding sequences.
Apart from lactate, the primary source of energy for microbial growth in cheese is metabolism of the abundant lipids and proteins, particularly casein (). We also identified gluta- mate importers (43/2264 or 1.9%, eg. K12942, K10005-K10008) and short peptide/nickel transport- ers (88/2264 or 3.9% eg. K03305) in our analysis, suggesting pathways for utilization of casein degradation products. Transporters for micronutrients, including phosphonate (K05781, K06163- K06165), molybdate (K02017, K02019, K02020, K03750, K03750, K03639), and metal ions like zinc and manganese were also identified.
HGT of drug resistance genes is of particular concern, as mobile resistance genes from food-asso- ciated microbes may be transferred to animal- and human-associated microbes (). Cheese rind communities often contain filamentous fungi including Penicillium species and other microbes that could potentially produce antimicrobial compounds and thus select for antibiotic resis- tance in co-occurring species. However, less than 1% of KEGG-annotated genes in this dataset are related to drug resistance. A tetracycline resistance gene was identified in eight Brevibacterium spe- cies (group 10) and a tripartite multidrug resistance system (K03446, K03543) in three Pseudomonas species (group 37).
We also noted a small number of genes from the core genome that were not expected to be hor-
izontally transferred. For example, group 27 is found in all 10 strains of B. linens in this dataset, as well as the closely related B. antiquum CNRZ918, and contains the SSU ribosomal protein S1p, as well as DNA Polymerase 1. It is possible that these results are false positives as B. linens and B. antiquum have an ANI ~88%, and these genes are typically more highly conserved than average. At the same time, other ribosomal genes that should also be highly conserved protein coding genes  have substantially lower homology between these species than S1p (). Fur- ther, another gene within this HGT group (SAM-dependent methyltransferase) is not typically highly conserved, but nevertheless is >99% identical between these Brevibacterium species. We cannot exclude the possibility that this is a false positive, but this may be an example of homologous recom- bination facilitated by the high sequence identity of the ribosomal protein  gene.  Several  other  groups also contain ribosomal proteins (42 L5p and S3p, 180 L4p, 219 S3p), but these groups do   not contain any other protein coding genes, and they are clustered with other ribosomal protein  coding genes, which is a more typical arrangement.

Iron acquisition HGT
The abundance of iron acquisition genes identified as HGT suggests that iron is a driving force in adaptation to growth on cheese. The largest HGT region we identified in cheese-associated bacte- ria, Group 1, includes an island of ~47 kbp (~1% of the genome of B. linens JB5) and 34 genes. This island is found in whole or in part in 15 different species in five different Actinobacterial genera (Bra- chybacterium, Brevibacterium, Corynebacterium, Microbacterium, and Glutamicibacter, formerly Arthrobacter), and one Firmicute (Alkalibacterium). The core of this region, flanked by AraC-like transcriptional regulators (e.g. Ga0099663_102740 and Ga0099663_102753 from JB182), contains several genes predicted to form a siderophore import complex, including two cell-surface associated substrate binding protein genes (Ga0099663_102743-44), two membrane permease genes (Ga0099663_102745-46), and an ATPase subunit (Ga0099663_102747). A siderophore reductase (Ga0099663_102741) is present immediately downstream of the AraC regulator, but has less than 99% identity between the species we analyzed (, ). We named this region iRon Uptake/Siderophore Transport Island (RUSTI).

Horizontally transferred genes are not always expressed in the recipient genome, because of pos- sible incompatibilities in promoter sequence (). As iron is a limiting resource in cheese (; ), we reasoned that if RUSTI is a functional   operon, it would likely have increased expression in the presence of additional competition for iron.  To assess whether RUSTI genes are regulated in the presence of competition, we grew G. arilaitensis JB182 alone or in the presence of Penicillium and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to monitor gene expression. The genes in RUSTI were significantly upregulated in the presence of a competing microbe relative to growth alone (, ), suggesting that this horizon-    tally transferred region is transcriptionally active and may be responding to competition for limited   iron in cheese.
Hundreds of different siderophores have been identified belonging to three major classes: hydroxamate, catecholate, and a-hydroxycarboxylate (). To predict the func- tion of the RUSTI transporters, we compared their protein sequences to the Transporter Classifica- tion Database (TCDB) () using BLAST (). The two genes annotated as permease subunits and one gene annotated as an ATP binding subunit each share sub- stantial homology with the catechol ferric enterobactin transport system (FepD, FepG, and FepC, respectively) in E. coli (; ;  ). Two genes annotated as substrate binding proteins have weak homology to vibriobactin and iron(III) dicitrate binding proteins from Vibrio cholerae and E. coli, respectively.
Siderophore-related genes are also well-represented in g-Proteobacterial HGT groups. Like Group 32 in Actinobacteria, Group 39 contains both siderophore acquisition and siderophore bio- synthesis genes and is found in three species of Psychrobacter. The HGT group with the most pro- tein coding genes that we identified in g -Proteobacteria (Group 7) is found in several Vibrio and Halomonas species, and like ActinoRUSTI contains an ABC siderophore transport system with indi- vidual substrate-binding, permease, and ATP-binding domains (). Although this group appears to have analogous function in the acquisition of iron with RUSTI from Actinobacteria, this ProteoRUSTI does not appear to be related. TCDB analysis suggests homology to hemin transport- ers in Yersinia pestis and Bordetella pertussis ().
The same gene island also contains genes related to the Phn family involved in phosphonate import and metabolism (). Phosphonate metabolism genes have previously been associated with iron siderophore acquisition in acidic environments (), and cheese is typically close to pH5 during the initial periods of rind community growth. Interestingly, BLAST of this region against the NCBI RefSeq database reveals that several uropathogenic E. coli strains share identical DNA sequences (). Highly similar sequences are found  in Oligella urethralis, another gram-negative pathogen of the urogenital tract, and Vibrio harveyi, a bioluminescent ocean-dwelling microbe. Iron sequestration by animals is a common defense against pathogens (), and enhanced iron acquisition is commonly associated with viru- lence. Mammals produce lactoferrin in milk for the same reason (), and these data sug- gest that the same genes would be adaptive in both pathogenesis and growth on cheese.
The convergence of strategies for both pathogenesis and growth on cheese was also demon- strated in the Firmicutes (). Two species of cheese-associated Staphylococcus (S. fleuretti CIP106114 and S. vitulinus Ma1) share a large (~20 kb) cluster of genes (Group 31) that includes hemolysin and fibronectin binding protein (FnBP), which are involved in virulence  in  S.  aureus (; ). Hemolysin (also known as alpha toxin) forms pores in cell membranes, and is so-called because of its ability to lyse red blood cells. FnBP enables binding to and invasion of cells, and has been implicated in formation of biofilms in methicillin resistant S. aureus (). It is unlikely that these genes provide a selective advantage to

cheese-associated Staphylococci, but Group 31 also contains genes for iron acquisition. These genes are homologous to the EfeUOB systems in E. coli and Bacillus subtilis and FepABC system in S. aureus, which are active in low-pH conditions (; ;  ). These iron acquisition genes are also found in association with hemolysin and FnBP in S. aureus and the animal-associated S. sciuri, although at only ~80% nucleotide identity  () (). As iron acquisition  genes may  be  adaptive  both on cheese and in pathogenesis, it is possible that this region was acquired from an animal path- ogen, and the virulence genes have been preserved because of their association with these genes.
The genomes sequenced are from a limited number of cheeses from Europe and the United States. To determine the distribution of RUSTI across a more expansive sample of cheese micro- biomes, we used BLAST searches against assembled metagenomic data from 38 different cheeses using representative Proteo-, Actino-, and Staph-RUSTI sequences (). Gene islands at least 97% identical to ActinoRUSTI were readily identified in 23 (61%) of these metagenomes, in both nat- ural and washed rind cheeses from the United States and Europe. Although less common (26% of metagenomes), ProteoRUSTI was also identified in diverse cheeses in both the US and Europe. StaphRUSTI could not be found in any of the metagenomes we analyzed. These data demonstrate that siderophore-associated HGT islands are widespread in cheese rind microbiomes. Whether inde- pendent   HGT   events   occur   within   each   cheese   production   and   aging   facility,   or   whether they occurred before the widespread distribution of these microbes across cheese produc- tion regions is unknown.

A potential mechanism of transfer and source of the Actinobacterial RUSTI
To begin to understand potential mechanisms which could mediate HGT in cheese-associated bacte- ria, we analyzed the sequences surrounding the RUSTI region of Glutamicibacter JB182. Conjugative elements are commonly involved in HGT (). Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) can in part be identified by the presence of signature proteins associated with core functions of integration into and excision from the host genome (recombinase), replication as an extrachromosomal element (polymerase), and conjugation from the host to recipient cell (conjuga- tion) (). Analysis of the Glutamicibacter  JB182 RUSTI region revealed homologs  of each of these protein classes (): a recombinase of the site-specific tyrosine recombinase XerD family (Ga0099663_102762) (), a hexameric ATPase conjugation pro- tein of the VirD4/TraG/TraD family (Ga0099663_102784) (), and a homolog of the bi-functional primase-polymerase DNA replication protein family (Ga0099663_102766). Interest- ingly, Actinobacterial ICE systems typically use conjugation apparatus belonging to the SpoIIE/FtsK family, which allows transfer of double-stranded DNA (;    ). However, the conjugation machinery here is more reminiscent of gram-negative and Firmi- cute systems of single-stranded transfer ().
ICE integration is site-specific, and frequently occurs at the 3' end of tRNA genes ( ). Immediately downstream of the RUSTI region in Glutamicibacter  is a leucine tRNA. The 3'  end of the tRNA forms an imperfect repeat with the region immediately upstream of the RUSTI  region, which strongly suggests that the tRNA-Leu is used at the integration site (att site) for this    ICE. To determine whether this ICE was still active, we performed PCR using primers within and flanking the putative integration site (). We were able to detect PCR products which sug- gest that at least a portion of the cells within the population have lost the RUSTI ICE from their chro- mosome, and it is present as an extrachromosomal circular form (). Sequencing of the PCR product (primers 1 + 6) that spans the predicted excision site matched the predicted remaining sequence, containing Repeat element B (). Sequencing of the PCR product (primers 2 + 5) that spans the predicted circularization site matched the predicted sequence, containing Repeat ele- ment A ().
There are several possible explanations for the widespread distribution of nearly identical Actino- RUSTI. Initial transfer events may have occurred in a single location, on the surface of a cheese or in livestock, and subsequently been dispersed to many separate cheesemaking facilities. The continued mobility of the ICE in JB182 raises the alternate possibility that it may be continually introduced to many cheeses from a common source. Cheese producers often use commercially available 'starter' cultures that contain desirable species, including many Actinobacteria (). We tested

Sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA genes for these isolates suggested that two isolates are Glutamicibacter arilaitensis and two are Brevibacterium linens. G. arilaitensis.

five common starter cultures for the presence of ActinoRUSTI by PCR, and positively identified it in one of these (). This culture is known to contain two species of Actinobacteria, Brevibacte- rium linens and Glutamicibacter nicotinae. To identify the RUSTI donor species, we plated the starter culture and isolated four distinct strains based on colony morphology. SSU sequencing revealed that two isolates were Glutamicibacter and two were Brevibacterium. One of the Brevibacterium isolates tested positive for ActinoRUSTI by PCR (). Although we have no evidence for direct trans- mission of ActinoRUSTI from this starter culture, and thus cannot definitively conclude that this was the source, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that HGT from a starter culture could  explain some of the dissemination of ActinoRUSTI.


Discussion
In this paper, we provide evidence of extensive horizontal gene transfer in cheese-associated bacte- ria. Many of the transferred regions are large multi-gene islands, and are shared by numerous spe- cies. Genes involved in nutrient acquisition, especially iron and lactate, are particularly abundant, suggesting that HGT may provide a selective advantage in the iron- and sugar-limited environment   of cheese. The largest HGT we identified appears to be an active ICE and is found in a starter cul- ture, raising the possibility that we are observing contemporary processes that may have ongoing importance. These data support previous studies that show HGT is an important factor in the evolu- tion of microbial communities () and suggest that cheese rind com- munities may provide a useful model for studying this process in greater detail.
For this study, we focused on bacterial members of the cheese microbiome, but many cheeses also contain numerous fungal species. Indeed, HGT has been previously documented in cheese-asso- ciated Penicillium species (). HGT between bacteria and fungi has also been documented in other environments, although it is thought to be rare (). Evaluating bacterial-fungal gene transfer in cheese could provide additional insights into the extent and importance of gene exchange in microbial communities. Further sequencing of bacterial  genomes from cheese could also continue to reveal HGT.
We were able to show that ActinoRUSTI in G. arilaitensis JB182 is likely contained within an inte- grative and conjugative element, although many other mechanisms for transfer are likely at play. Indeed, the appearance of phage-related genes, transposases, and other mobile elements in many HGT groups suggests that we are observing the results of multiple methods for mobilizing DNA.
Our method  for identifying HGT  does not  permit determination  of the direction  of gene flow,   and indeed it seems likely that the original sources of many of these genetic elements are not pres- ent in our dataset. In some cases, we can infer a possible origin, such as the Brevibacterium strain in a starter culture that may be the source of RUSTI in multiple cheese species around the world. How- ever, this does not permit identification of where this species acquired them. Further characteriza-  tion of cheese-associated microbes, as well as those found in dairy farms or in cheese caves may provide a more complete picture, but the evidence that at least some of these genetic elements are found in human pathogens and ocean-dwelling bacteria suggests that genes are shared across diverse environments.
Although previous studies demonstrated that iron is limiting for Glutamicibacter, Brevibacterium, and Corynebacterium species growing on cheese (, ), the preponderance     of siderophore and other iron acquisition genes we observed being horizontally transferred suggests that the same is true across bacterial phyla. Limiting iron is a deliberate strategy on the part of mam- malian hosts to block the growth of infectious microbes, and this strategy influences the composition of milk because of the presence of lactoferrin (). Interestingly, convergent strategies for acquiring iron are used by pathogens and by cheese-associated microbes and we observe that in some cases these disparate species appear to have shared genes through horizontal transfer. The

presence of these same genes in a microbe found in ocean habitats suggests that these genes have broad utility for the common challenge of iron limitation.
We have yet to demonstrate the functional consequences of these genes on individual species or on the community as a whole. Given that iron is limiting in cheese, and that ActinoRUSTI genes are upregulated in response to other species (), it is likely that these genes are functional and may play a role in competition. The prevalence of siderophore import, but not siderophore synthesis pathways suggests that species may cheat by scavenging the biosynthetic products of others  ().
The identification of widespread sharing of genes in cheese microbial communities could have important implications. In particular, the possibility that a starter culture is the source of mobile gene elements suggests that the genomic content, rather than just specific species, must be considered when designing microbial supplements. In addition to starter cultures used for fermented foods, liv- ing microbial  supplements  ('probiotics')  are  increasingly  being  adopted  in  agriculture  (; ) and for a wide range of human health conditions (; ;     ), and even as cosmetics (). The need to screen for clinically relevant ele- ments such as antibiotic resistance genes is widely recognized (), but other mobile gene elements from these organisms may also enter native microbial populations with unknown consequences.
Although we and others have observes a large number of HGT events in microbial species across a diverse range of environments (; ;   ), the biotic and  abiotic conditions that affect this frequency, and what effects HGT  may have  on the community remain unclear. A model system to study HGT in a community context is particu- larly important, as sequence-based characterization of complex communities has particular limita- tions when it comes to HGT. Further, even if complete characterization in situ were possible, many microbial communities are difficult to experimentally manipulate in vitro.
By contrast, cheese rind-associated bacteria are readily isolated and cultured, and model commu- nities may enable identification of features of microbial  communities and their  environments that  alter frequency and extent of HGT. The cheese rind model system provides an  opportunity  to observe HGT as it happens and to investigate how community composition affects the frequency of transfer and the persistence of genes. The in vitro cheese system enables experimental manipulation to investigate the role of community composition in driving HGT. Further, as many gene products   may only have survival benefits in the context of community competition and cooperation, investi- gating the role of RUSTI and other horizontally transferred genes on microbial growth in the context  of their natural community is critical. Having an experimentally tractable microbial community will  allow us to test these ideas under controlled conditions in the laboratory and generate predictions about how these processes work in more complex natural systems. Many species of cheese-associ- ated bacteria have close relatives in the soil, on skin, in the ocean, making insight from this system potentially applicable to diverse environments. In addition, horizontal acquisition  of  iron-uptake  genes has been documented in numerous environments including the oceans and in human patho- gens (; ), suggesting that the specific processes occur- ring in cheese may also be generally informative across systems. Understanding the extent of HGT in the cheese microbiome is the first step towards addressing how  the movement  of genes shapes,  and is shaped by, a microbial community. Using cheese rinds as a model system could help elucidate the factors that influence the frequency of HGT, how it impacts competition and cooperation, and helps shape a microbiome.


Materials and methods
Sequencing and genome assembly
Bacterial strains JB4, 5, 7, 37, 110, 182, 196, and 197 were isolated from cheeses in a single geo- graphic region and sequenced using a combination of Illumina short-read (100 bp, paired end) and Pacbio long-read sequencing. DNA was extracted using Genomic Tip 100/G (Qiagen, USA) or Power Soil (MoBio, USA). Illumina library preparation and sequencing were performed at Harvard University

by the Bauer Core facility. Pacbio library preparation and sequencing were performed by the Univer- sity of Massachusetts Medical School Deep Sequencing Core. De novo hybrid assembly was per- formed using SPAdes (v3.5.0) (). Genomes were annotated using the Integrated Microbial Genomes Expert Review (IMG/ER) annotation pipeline  (  ). In addition, we also sequenced eight additional rind isolates of  Brachybacterium (strains 341.9, 738.10, 862.8, 876.9, 900.8, 908.11, 947.1, 962.10) and Brevibacterium (strains 341.13, 738.8,
862.7, 876.7, 900.6, 908.7, 947.7, 962.8) and three additional isolates of Glutamicibacter (strains BW77, 78, 80) from different cheeses in a broad geographic distribution. For these isolates, we pre- pared draft genomes using Illumina short-read sequencing and assembled with CLC genomics workbench.
The annotated genomes used can be found on Zenodo ()

Phylogenetic trees
16S sequences were retrieved from the sequenced genomes and aligned using the structure-based aligner, Infernal v1.1rc4 (), as implemented in the Ribosomal Database Project release 11 (). The alignment was imported into Geneious v9 (Biomatters, LTD), and a tree was calculated using the maximum likelihood method PHYML (GTR model) (). The tree was rooted using Thermus thermophilus. The tree was then  uploaded to Interactive Tree of Life (iTOLv3) () to enable mapping of HGT  data (connections and group abundance profiles).

RNAseq
Four replicate transcriptomes from two treatments were sequenced: (1) G. arilaitensis alone and (2)
G. arilaitensis + Penicillium. We used a strain of Penicillium solitum that was isolated from a natural rind cheese and was used for experiments in . For each experimental unit, approximately 80,000 CFUs of Glutimicibacter arilaitensis were spread across the surface of a 100 mm Petri dish containing 20 mL of cheese curd agar (10% freeze-dried fresh cheese, 3% NaCl, 1.7% agar, 0.5% xanthan gum) (). For the + Penicillium treatment, approximately 100,000 CFUs were co-inoculated onto the plates with the Glutimicibacter. Plates were incubated in a bin with moist paper towel (>90% relative humidity) at 24@C for 5 days.
Rind biofilms were then harvested by scraping the cheese curd surface and stored in RNAProtect
Reagent (Qiagen) to stabilize mRNA frozen at -80@C. RNA was extracted using a standard phenol- chloroform protocol used for many different fungal and bacterial species, which has been adopted from transcriptomics work in gut microbiomes (see []). This protocol uses a stan- dard bead-beating step in a lysis buffer to release cell contents from biofilms stored in RNAProtect. DNA was removed from the samples using a TURBO DNA-free kit (Life Technologies), and 5S tRNA and large rRNA was depleted using MEGAClear (Life Technologies) and RiboZero (Illumina) kits, respectively. To remove both fungal and bacterial large rRNA, we used an equal mixture of Ribo-  Zero Yeast and Bacteria rRNA Removal Solution. To confirm that the samples were free of DNA con- taminants, a PCR of the 16S rRNA gene was performed with standard primers (27 f and 1492 r). Overall quantity and quality of the RNA preps were confirmed by Nanodrop and Agilent 2100 Bioa- nalyzer using the RNA 6000 Nano kit.
RNA-seq libraries were constructed from purified mRNA using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs) where each library received a unique six base pair bar- code for demultiplexing after the sequencing run. Each library was run on an Agilent 2100 Bioana- lyzer High Sensitivity DNA chip to confirm that primer dimers and adapter dimers were not present in the sample and to determine the size of the library. Final libraries were standardized to 10 nM each after quantification with a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies) and then pooled in equal amounts to get similar sequencing coverage across all libraries. The pooled library samples were sequenced using paired-end 100 bp reads on an Illumina HiSeq Rapid Run by the Harvard Bauer Core Sequencing Core Facility.
To quantify gene expression and determine whether genes within RUSTI were differentially expressed when grown with the competitor Penicillium, we used Rockhopper ( ). Only forward reads were used for this analysis. The assembled and annotated Glutamici- bacter arilaitensis strain JB182 (described above) genome were used as a reference genome for

mapping. We considered genes that had a greater than fourfold difference  in  expression when grown with Penicillium or Staphylococcus and were significantly different (based on Rockhopper's q- values, which control for false discovery rate using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure) to be differ- entially expressed genes.

PCR
PCR reactions were performed using Q5 Hot Start Mastermix (New England Biolabs). Where JB182 RUSTI is integrated in the chromosome, PCR using primer 1 (CAACTGTGCCACGCAATTCA) and primer 2 (CGGCTACTTCTCGGATGGTC) are expected to produce a 1037 bp product that includes the 5' ICE repeat. Primer 3 (CGCAATCGTGGTGTATCTGC) and primer 4 (GACGGGATCAGGAAC- GACG) should produce a 1410 bp product, while primer 5 (GCCGCATCTACCTCGATGAA) and primer 6 (CCAAATCGCGACGCATTGAT) are expected to form a 1467 bp product. Primers 1 and 6 are separated by approximately 59 kb when RUSTI is present and are not expected to form a PCR product, but should form a 1937 bp product if RUSTI is excised. Primers 2 and 5 should not form a PCR product when RUSTI is integrated, but would form a 500 bp product if the excision circle were present.

Additional software
Annotated genomes were compared using blastn from BLAST+ (v2.3.0) (). Pro- tein coding genes were considered to be potential HGT if their sequence was at least 99% identical for at least 500 nucleotides. Neighboring candidate HGT were identified as part of the same island if they were separated by no more than 5000 nucleotides. Scripts to import and store genome infor- mation and blast results and to analyze results are available on github (;   A copy is archived at  
Genomic average nucleotide identity (ANI) was calculated using the 'ani.rb' script from the enveomics collection (commit 'e8faed01ff848222afb5820595cccc4e50c89992') with default settings ().

Metagenomes
Shotgun metagenomic data from () and () were assembled  with CLC Genomic Workbench 8.0. Representative sequences for ActinoRUSTI or ProteoRUSTI were compared with assembled metagenomes  by  BLAST.  Hits  with  >97%  similarity  were  considered to be positive hits for target regions.

Genomes from Almeida et. al. do not yet have accession numbers. (b) Pairwise species comparison summary total. Protein coding sequences (column 'Shared CDS') and nucleotides (in base-pairs - column 'Shared  nt') determined to be horizontally transferred for every pair of species that were compared by the  HGT detection pipeline. Also shows calculated ANI and 16S similarity in % (column ssu - see Materi- als and methods for method of determining 16S similarity). Species pairs that have ANI > 0.89 were not compared and are not shown. (c) HGT identification parameters. Different parameters for mini- mum length of gene match for HGT, maximum % ANI identity for related species, and maximum dis- tance between genes in an island were compared. Number of positive HGT hits identified when varying the minimum protein coding gene length. Number of HGT groups constructed when varying the maximum separation between hits that are classified as belonging to the same group. Number    of nucleotides or number of protein coding sequences in HGT regions by 16S similarity. Note - There are no results below 500 as 500 bp is the minimum length for protein coding sequences in this analy- sis. (d) Full group annotations. All protein coding sequences identified as HGT, sorted by group # (ranked by total nucleotide content), species and genome location within species. Certain functional annotations are identified by color (e.g. orange for iron) based on text in annotation. Locus tags and contig IDs beginning with lower case letters were assigned by kvasir, and do not correspond to any published database. (e) Group summary statistics. Summary statistics for each HGT group. (f) Highly conserved genes in Brevibacterium species. Protein coding sequences from Group 29, as well as selected highly conserved genes from Brevibacterium antiquum CNRZ918 were compared  with  other Brevibacterium strains by BLAST. B. linens 947.7 has substantially lower nucleotide identity for the four genes found in Group 29 than other B. linens strains, despite similar nt distance for other highly conserved genes. This suggests that Group 29 is a true example of HGT between CNRZ918 and other B. linens strains, rather than a false positive. (g) RUSTI gene expression during competi- tion.
