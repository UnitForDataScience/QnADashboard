Due to declining estrogen levels during menopause, NAFLD prevalence is higher in postmenopausal women compared to in premenopausal women or in men. Postmenopausal women are more susceptible to weight gain, fat redistribution and dyslipidemia, all major hallmarks of metabolic syndrome associated with increased NAFLD risk. Gut microbiota plays important roles in development of gastrointestinal tract, metabolism and immunity. Host-microbe interactions allows regulation of a wide range of pathways that affect healthy and diseased physiology. Recent advances in - omics technologies, such as microbiome, transcriptome and metabolome analysis, provided evidence that estrogens and intestinal microbiota (IM) can collectively influence obesity, inflammatory disease, diabetes, and cancers. By understanding underlying mechanisms of estrogens and mi- crobiota crosstalk, we might design dietary and pharmacological interventions to alleviate the metabolic syn- drome and NAFLD.




Metabolic health of postmenopausal women and hormone replacement therapy

The prevalence of obesity among women is increasing, yet there is no such significant trend for men. Currently, 70% of postmenopausal women are overweight or obese. According to 2003-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, metabolic syndrome is present in about 34% of the population and the rates of metabolic syndrome is increasing among postmenopausal women . Metabolic syndrome is defined as a collection of metabolic pathologies that increase an individual's risk of heart disease, diabetes, cancer and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) . National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the American Heart Association (AHA) identified risk factors for metabolic syndrome as a fasting glucose
>=100 mg/dL,	blood	pressure	>=130/85 mm Hg,	triglycerides
>=150 mg/dL, HDL-C < 40 mg/dL, and waist circumference >=102 cm in men or >=88 cm in women . Metabolic syndrome is diagnosed if an individual has 3 out of 5 of these risk factors. In addition, having these symptoms is not associated with mortality in older men, yet elevated glucose or low HDL levels are strongly associated with mor- tality in older women .
Estrogens, which are necessary for the development and function of reproductive tissues, have many beneficial effects in diverse, non-re- productive target tissues, such as liver, fat pads, bone and vasculature.

The loss of these benefits and the development of obesity after meno- pause highlights the estrogen receptor, especially the receptor subtype ERa, as a relevant therapeutic target. These effects, including insulin resistance and altered glucose homeostasis, can be reversed by estradiol (E2) treatment . The American Association of Clinical En- docrinologist, the American College of Endocrinology , the North American Menopause Society and the Endocrine Society re- cognize the metabolic benefits of HRT in their guidelines but do not recommend HRT use for prevention or treatment of these symptoms due to insufficient data and potential risks. Currently, HRT is only prescribed to women who display clinical symptoms, is given at the lowest dose possible, and is continued only as long as the clinical symptoms are present. Due to potential risks associated with these products, they are not used long-term or for prevention. Moreover, the patient needs to be constantly monitored by a general practitioner to catch any problems that might arise due to HRT use. Hence, there re- mains a critical need for safer alternatives that target the signaling pathways of the estrogen receptor (ER) in ways that maintain the postmenopausal health of metabolic tissues without stimulating re- productive tissues.
Current HRT typically consists of an estrogen or estrogen in com-
bination with a progestin, and may be taken to relieve hot flashes or to treat osteoporosis. Though the initial reason a woman would take HRT are usually not metabolic, there are many metabolic benefits to HRT

including diminishing insulin resistance and improving glucose home- ostasis . HRT has also been shown to favorably influence liver enzymes and potentially lower liver fat accumulation in women with type 2 diabetes . However, though HRT has many metabolic ben- efits, they have been shown to increase risks of certain cancers in- cluding breast cancer and endometrial cancers . Therefore, it is essential to find safer alternatives to HRT such as novel and synthetic estrogens that can maintain the health of non-reproductive tissues without stimulating reproductive tissues.
Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are compounds that can bind to estrogen receptors and can exert agonistic or antag- onistic activity. Bazedoxifene (BZA) is one such SERM that has estrogen agonist activity in bone and reduces osteoporosis while possibly having antagonistic activity in the breast and uterus . In mice, the an- tagonistic effects of BZA in the mammary gland can block E2 and in- hibit the growth of tamoxifen sensitive and resistant tumors . In cell culture models conjugated estrogen (CE) was much less potent in in- ducing breast cancer cell proliferation, and BZA entirely suppressed this effect . Although classic HRT uses an estrogen and progestin in combination, replacing progestin with SERMs could more effectively prevent side-effects. This new combination of estrogen and SERM has been described as the tissue-selective estrogen complexes (TSECs). Most notably, the TSEC comprised of CE and BZA has been shown to prevent osteoporosis with minimal effects on reproductive organs . This combination was approved by the FDA for the prevention of post- menopausal osteoporosis and the treatment of moderate-to-severe va- somotor symptoms caused by menopause. Recently, the possibility of this TSEC in preventing metabolic disorders is beginning to be explored. It has been shown that the TSECs prevent visceral adiposity and had a significant impact on body weight increase compared to control in ovariectomized mice . CE + BZA caused a significant decrease in both uterine and mesenteric white adipose tissue (WAT), but did not influence the uterine weight, which CE only and E2 treatments did . TSEC decreases serum leptin levels, leptin/adiponectin ratio, and levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) compared to control mice suggesting normalization of serum adipokines and sys- temic inflammation . Furthermore, the TSEC decreased hepatic fatty acid synthase (FAS) enzymatic activity  and significant de- creases in liver lipid deposition suggesting benefits to liver health.

NAFLD and estrogens

NAFLD is the most common form of chronic liver disease in the United States and is characterized by histologic hepatitis in the absence of alcohol abuse . Though simple steatosis is considered benign, steatosis of the liver can progress to the more serious conditions of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis . Population studies have demonstrated that while premenopausal women have less NAFLD compared to men, postmenopausal women have higher in- cidences of NAFLD than men , which suggests a protective role for estrogens. The decrease in estrogens due to the onset of menopause makes postmenopausal women more susceptible to weight gain, fat redistribution to abdominal areas, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance, all of which are major hallmarks of metabolic syndrome and are asso- ciated with NAFLD . Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use reduces NAFLD incidence in postmenopausal women . Use of Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, increases NAFLD incidence . In addition, both the aromatase knock-out mice , which are devoid of endogenous estrogens, and ERa knock-out mice had hepatic steatosis. All this evidence suggest a role for ERa signaling and estrogen deficiency in NAFLD progression in both human and mice.
The pathogenesis of NAFLD is complex, and there are significant
links between NAFLD and abnormal lipid metabolism as seen in obesity
and metabolic syndrome. The prevalence of NAFLD increases with in- creasing body mass index (BMI), with the rates of steatosis and

steatohepatits at 65% and 20% respectively in obese individuals (BMI 30.0-39.9 kg/m2) and 85% and 40% respectively in extremely obese patients (BMI >= 40 kg/m2) . The prevalence of NAFLD is about 69% in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) . Risk factors for NAFLD include dietary fat consumption, insulin resistance, elevated serum free fatty acids, excess visceral adiposity, and pro-inflammatory markers . These factors contribute to the accumulation of excessive hepatic fat and oxidative stress, that are components of the "two-hit hypothesis" that explain disease etiology . Therefore, targeting one or both of these factors may be beneficial in treating NAFLD as there are currently no FDA approved therapies for NAFLD.
The present Dietary Guidelines indicate that more than 35% of daily energy consumed by Americans is from fat, particularly saturated fats, and added sugar . Excess consumption of saturated fat and sugar contributes to increased body fatness and to the progression of chronic, low-level inflammation, thus, adversely impacting hepatic health and aggravating chronic diseases such as diabetes and hepatocellular car- cinogenesis. Hepatic cancer risk increases with the progression into NASH, which accounts for 20-25% of patients with NAFLD . Since saturated fatty acids are not a priority substrate for b-oxidation, they are a poor source of energy, and are directed toward storage in the liver . Saturated fatty acids increase endoplasmic reticular stress and free radical production in mitochondria, which promotes the cellular da- mage and eventually, development of NASH . Fructose, which is a component of sucrose, is a highly lipogenic nutrient, enhancing hepatic triglyceride accumulation through the de novo lipogenesis pathway . Therefore, the components of Westernized diet disrupts lipid homeostasis and oxidative balance in the liver and enables the onset and the progression of NAFLD.

Mechanisms of metabolic regulation by estrogens

In humans, there are three major estrogens endogenous to the human body. These are estrone (E1), 17b-estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3) with E2 being the most potent . Estrogens are derived from cholesterol by reactions catalyzed by the P450 aromatase . E2 has the greatest affinity for estrogen receptors and a higher bioactivity . Several tissues are able to generate estrogens in humans including the reproductive organs of both males and females, the liver, osteoblasts, muscle cells, skin, and adipose tissue . In premenopausal women, the ovaries produce the majority of the estrogen released into circula- tion . However, after menopause, ovaries stop functioning, dra- matically decreasing the concentrations of estrogen in the body. Es- trogen synthesis continues in adipose tissue and adipose tissue-derived estrogen accounts for most of the circulating estrogens in post- menopausal women . A longitudinal study showed that trends in obesity and hormone levels in women differed by menopausal status . Obese and overweight women had significantly lower con- centrations of estradiol than non-obese premenopausal women how- ever, this trend was reversed after menopause where obese and over- weight women have higher estradiol levels than non-obese women, due aromatization of estrogens in adipose tissue.
The molecular mechanism of action of estrogens in each tissue is
determined (a) by the ER composition of the tissue; (b) by the com- position of coregulators and partnering transcription factors, (c) and notably, as we and others have shown, also by the activation of genomic vs. non-genomic pathways by estrogens. Our previous studies showed that reproductive tissues, including endometrium and the mammary gland, which express dominantly ERa, are not stimulated by ligands that preferentially activate non-genomic ER signaling . These tissues rely mostly on genomic signaling for the maintenance and proliferation of these tissues and the cancers that arise in them . Studies in- volving mice expressing membrane-only ERa (MOER) showed defects in uterus and mammary gland development . Interestingly, liver defects associated with lipid metabolism observed in ERa knockout
mice were not found in MOER mice , suggesting that membrane

ERa signaling is sufficient to suppress lipid synthesis in the liver. In addition, findings from mice with ERa that cannot bind estrogen re- sponse elements, named KIKO mice, was protected from ovariectomy and high-fat diet induced obesity upon estrogen supplementation, suggesting that direct ERE binding is not required for metabolic effects of ERa .
ERa is more associated with obesity and maintaining adipose tissue function . ERa knockout (ERaKO) mice are more prone to obesity and have a reduced energy expenditure regardless of gender. These results differ from ERb knockout mice, which do not have significant increase in visceral fat mass. Furthermore, ERaKO mice have increased central adiposity. ERaKO mice have double the weight of fat pads compared to wild type animals even though energy intake are about equal. Studies in liver ERa knock-out mice (LERKO) showed that liver ERa is required for preventing aberrant hepatic lipid deposition in both males and females .
Even though ERa have more direct effects in metabolic regulation, ERb is also reported to have effects on the mechanism of fat accumu- lation and distribution. In the absence of adipose ERa, ERb prevents inflammation and fibrosis . Interestingly, ERb was suggested to influence microbiota maintenance in the gut . The gastrointestinal microbiota have hydrolytic capabilities, which may expand and reduce the ability of the host to absorb and intake dietary components. In addition to direct effects in the gut and microbiome, ERb is expressed in the dorsal raphe, a region of the brain where cell bodies of serotonin neurons originate . Serotonin neurons are critical in the regulation of food intake. It has also been proposed that ERb is important for the maintenance of normal glucose and lipid metabolism in the body . Estrogens regulate adipocyte metabolism and induce remodeling of particular adipose depots, which are different between premenopausal women and men compared to post-menopausal women . Estrogen Receptors partner with other transcription factors including LXR, SREBP and especially cHREBP to regulate metabolism and readers are encouraged to read the detailed review on this topic (REF. Ellis Levin review on "Membrane estrogen receptors signal to determine tran- scription factor function"). Estrogens can decrease lipogenesis by in- hibiting lipoprotein lipase (LPL) . LPL is responsible for hydro- lyzing triglycerides and facilitates adipose tissue storage. An in vitro study using mouse adipocyte cell lines showed that fat accumulation depended on the expression of this enzyme as E2 treatment decreased LPL mRNA, which blocked lipid deposition in turn. This effect is regulated by an estrogen-response suppressive element in the LPL promoter gene. Increased levels of LPL have been shown in adipose tissue of obese human patients . In obese women, plasma estradiol activity has a strong negative correlation with LPL activity in adipose and postheparin plasma. These studies suggest that estrogen may di- rectly influence fat storage and limit fat accumulation in adipocytes by
decreasing LPL action.
In ovariectomized mice fed a high fat diet, E2 administration im- proved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. When estrogen pro- duction decreases, as in menopause or following ovariectomy, the body weight increases. This increase can be prevented by estradiol treatment . In terms of glucose homeostasis, aromatase knockout mice had hepatic insulin resistance because of decreased Akt phosphoryla- tion in the liver . Akt is a key mediator in the insulin signaling pathways. With estrogen administration, Akt phosphorylation of ar- omatase knockout mice was restored reversing these effects. Therefore, estradiol treatment in estrogen deficient mice improved insulin sensi- tivity by increasing the phosphorylation of the key mediators in insulin signaling .
In addition to direct effects of estrogens on metabolic tissues, ERs are also expressed in regions of central nervous system (CNS) that regulates food intake and energy expenditure . ERa is the main mediator of estrogen action in CNS and play important roles in main- taining function of specialized neuronal circuits such as  pro-opiomela-
nocortin (POMC) neurons or ventral medial hypothalamus (VMH) and

regulating levels and activity of several adipokines including leptin, adiponectin and NPY . The levels of adipokines, such as adi- ponectin and leptin may be affected by estrogen concentrations . Aiponectin is prodced by adipocytes and are involved in fatty acid metabolism and glucose regulation . Levels of adiponectin are in- versely correlated with the concentrations of plasma estrogen levels in females even though females have higher overall concentrations of plasma adiponectin than males do. However, this might be due to other hormones such as testosterone that results in the dimorphic differences in adiponectin levels. strogen increases leptin production as well as leptin receptor expression in rats and humans . Supplementation of estrogen in postmenopausal women caused an increase in circulating leptin levels. In ovariectomized female rats injected with exogenous leptin, responsiveness to the anorexigenic effects of leptin were reduced and these mice had much higher food intake and increase in body weight than intact females. As leptin inhibits hunger and influences satiety, estrogens can aid in energy regulation and food intake to con- trol obesity through this mechanism. Other adipokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were also shown to be increased following estrogen treatment of aromatase knockout mice . These data show that estrogens control the levels of different adipokines associated with glucose and lipid metabolism which may lead to the higher instances of obesity after menopause when estrogen levels decline.
Estrogens regulate expression levels of several genes that are im-
portant for lipid deposition. FASN is fatty acid synthase which syn- thesizes fatty acids. Estradiol regulates FASN expression in liver and adipocytes by modulating downstream signaling pathway cross-talk . In ovariectomized mice, FASN levels were increased, which were reversed by the administration of an estrogen receptor ligand. Estrogen also appears to upregulate a2A-adrenergic receptors in human adipose tissue which lowers the lipolytic response in subcutaneous adipose tissue of healthy women . By upregulating these receptors only in subcutaneous adipose tissue and not in abdominal adipose tissue, fat accumulation is higher in subcutaneous areas. This may ex- plain why females have higher deposits in these areas compared to the higher abdominal fat accumulation in males. SREBP-1 is sterol reg- ulatory element-binding protein 1 which is involved in glucose meta- bolism, fatty acid production, and cholesterol production. After ovar- iectomy, expression of SREBP-1c, one of the isoforms of the SREBP, was much higher than in intact mice . Like FASN, administration of estrogens decreased expression of SREBP-1 to prevent fat accumulation .

Interaction of microbiota and estrogens

Gut microbiota composition has a major impact on metabolic status of the host. Insulin sensitivity of mice can be improved by small in- testine infusion of gut microbiota samples from healthy donors in mice . In a healthy gut, microbiota digests resistant starch and fibers, synthesize vitamins, provide immunity, and prevent pathogen coloni- zation . If gut microbiota is disrupted, bacterial metabolites and bacterial cell components can reduce intestinal epithelial integrity and access the liver through the portal vein. These microbial byproducts can contribute to inflammation, liver steatosis, and hepatic injury ulti- mately leading to NAFLD .
High fat diet changes gut microbiota composition and increases the concentration of gram negative bacteria, which produces endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) . As gram negative bacteria produces endotoxins increase inflammation as associated diseases such as type 2 diabetes  and NAFLD . NAFLD is strongly influenced by obesity and insulin resistance . In fact, gut microbiota composi- tion is altered in NAFLD where certain bacterial overgrowths contribute to disease development and progression . Insulin sensitivity of
mice can be improved by small intestine infusion of gut microbiota samples  from  healthy  donors  in  mice  .  Manipulating  the  gut

microbiota composition with probiotics and prebiotics, such as Lacto- bacillus and Bifidobacterium strains also improve weight and fat mass development. Mice fed a high fat diet had improved glucose-insulin homeostasis and attenuated weight gain when supplemented with Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium probiotics.
Gut microorganism composition can be altered with the addition of various chemical substrates and dietary administration of estrogen-like compounds were shown to promote the proliferation and growth of certain types of bacteria . Dietary consumption of soy isoflavones such as daidzein, genistein, and glycitin can significantly alter fecal bacterial community structure and composition in postmenopausal women . Specifically, soy phytoestrogen consumption increases the concentration of Bifidobacterium, a bacteria beneficial to gut health, and suppresses Clostridiaceae, an opportunistic pathogens which cause of several human diseases . As estrogens influence the microbiota, some bacteria also metabolize estrogen-like compounds or phytoestrogens, such as soy isoflavones to produce more biologically active forms that have high affinity for human estrogen receptors . Higher serum levels of gut microbial metabolites of phytoestrogen lig- nans were associated with a lower weight in postmenopausal women . Some gut bacteria are known to metabolize phytoestrogens into O-desmethylangolensin (ODMA) and equol, which are structurally si- milar to mammalian estrogen . ODMA producing individuals are leaner . Equol supplementation improves glycemic control and lowers LDL levels . Recently we showed that dietary li- corice root supplementation, which contain isoliquiritegenin, a low- affinity ER ligand, improved ovariectomy associated weight gain and metabolic syndrome in mice . Administration of this botanical estrogen did not stimulate reproductive tissues. However, how iso- liquiritegenin or any other low affinity estrogen supplementation would alter gut microbiota and blood metabolites is not known.
As estrogens are metabolized by the liver through first-pass meta-
bolism and biotransformed through methylation, hydroxylation, and conjugation. The estrobolome, collection of estrogen metabolizing en- zymes associated with gut microbioata, could further alter these transformed estrogens and generate novel ligands of varying potency for estrogen receptors . For example, some bacterial species with b-glucosidase activity can deconjugate estrogens, producing estrogens with higher biological activity . Higher gut microbial diversity is associated with more estrogen metabolites in urine . Increased parent estrogen concentrations compared to estrogen metabolites in serum have been associated with a low gut microbial diversity and increased breast cancer risk . Estrogen metabolite to parent estrogen ratio may also be an important indicator of metabolic dys- function. These findings suggest gut microbiome as a potential bio- marker for identifying metabolic disease risk and eventually preventing these diseases using probiotic interventions.

Conclusions and future research

Estrogens are key in maintaining homeostasis in healthy pre- menopausal individuals. When estrogen levels decrease with meno- pause, metabolic rate decreases, causing increased weight and obesity. However, we still do not know how certain estrogens may alter the microbiome to resemble normal weight phenotypes or how gut estro- genic byproducts produced by gut bacteria may act as ER ligands to mediate metabolic functions. It may be possible that the microbiota metabolize endogenous or dietary estrogens to produce novel ER li- gands that can also be used to mitigate symptoms associated with menopause and obesity. Alternatively, the microbiota may be ma- nipulated to produce less potent estrogens that could maintain meta- bolic function but reduce the risk of other diseases such as cancer. By identifying and analyzing other forms of estrogen that may be less potent and bind loosely to receptors, it may be possible to find more
effective forms of estrogen replacement therapies. Treatment may also involve   using   microbiota   therapies   in   combination with  estrogen

therapies that work independently or synergistically to provide a more holistic treatment approach to prevent metabolic disease.
