Human gut microbiome is defined asthe gene complement of the gut microbial community, measured via laboratory metagenomic techniques. It includes bacteriome, virome and mycobiome, which represent, respectively, the assemblages of bacteria, viruses and fungi, living in the human gut. Gut microbiota function as a living "organ" that interacts with the gastro-intestinal environment, provides nutrients and vitamins to the organism and transduces hormonal messages, essentially influencing the main metabolic pathways, including drug metabolism. A clear association between gut, and glucose metabolism disorders has recently emerged. Medications acting on glucose absorption in the gut, or enhancing gut hormone activity are already extensively employed in the therapy of diabetes. Moreover, the gut is characterized by immune, and autonomous neuronal features, which play a critical role in maintaining glucose metabolism homeostasis. Gut microbes respond to neuroendocrine, and immune biochemical messages, affecting the health, and behavior of the host. There is vast heterogeneity in the studies included in this review, hence ameta-analysis, orasystematic review were not applicable. In this article, we attempt to reveal the interplay between human gut microbiota physiology, and hyperglycemic states, synthesizing, and interpreting findings from human studies.

Introduction
Human gut ecology first received the attention of the winner of the 1908 Nobel prize of Medicine or Physiology (jointly with Paul Ehrlich) Elia Metchnikoff (1845-1916). During his late years, Metchnikoff formed the 'oral bacteriotherapy' theory  based  on his observations on the longevity of mountain farmers that consumed fermented milk . Mark Lyte coined the term 'Microbial Endocrinology' to describe the interactions of the microbiota with the host in 1993, and since  then,  his  studies  have revealed the unequivocal relations of microbes with the neuroendocrine cross-talk with the brain . Later on, bariatric surgery studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) demonstrated remission of the disease, probably due in part to the anatomic bypass of microbiota . The human gut microbiota refers to the collection of microbial organisms that inhabit the human gut. Metagenomics contributed to the characterization of the microbiome taxonomy, leading to the understanding of transorganismal behaviors . Microbiome is defined as the gene



stressors, resulting in increase in the secretion of stress-related hormones, such as cortisol, catecholamines and interleukin-6. Of note, gut dysbiosis, defined either as loss of beneficial organisms, and expansion of pathobionts, or loss of gut microbiota diversity ( ), has been implicated in many diabetes studies .


Material and Methods

In this non-systematic review, we attempted to reveal the interplay between microbiota physiology, and hyperglycaemic states, summarizing, and synthesizing findings from published human studies. To do so, a systematic research was performed by employing the terms 'Type 1 Diabetes, Type 2 Diabetes, gesta- tional diabetes, and prediabetes' and 'gut microbiome, bacteriome mycobiome, virome' in humans accordingly, in PubMed, EBSCO, Google Scholar databases, and the ResearchGate site.

complement of the gut community measured via laboratory	 	

metagenomic techniques . Human gut  microbiome  includes the bacteriome and the virome, assemblages of the bacteria and viruses, respectively, that reside in the human gut, and the mycobiome, a term used to describe the fungal genome in the human gut (). All microorganisms colonizing the gut are reported collectively under the term gut microbiota. The latter, functions as a living "organ" that interacts with the gastro- intestinal environment, provides nutrients and vitamins to the organism, transduces hormonal messages, and influences even- tually the main metabolic pathways, including drug metabolism . The human gut microbiome is usually characterized by its species richness (qualitative classification of gut microorganisms) and its species "evenness" (quantitative evaluation of each species). The combined species richness and evenness, in ecological terms, is expressed as gut microbiome diversity .
During the past decade, human gut microbiota has been implicated as a causal, or contributing factor  in the pathogenesis of many clinical entities, such as inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, sepsis, asthma, obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes mellitus . Consequently, a substan- tial amount of studies, regarding gut microbiome rapidly ensued.
Diabetes encompasses all the hyperglycemic states. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality as well as public health costs . Glycemic control is disturbed by endogenous or exogenous

Gut Microbiome and Disorders of Glucose Metabolism

Gut microbiome includes a wide variation in microorganisms (). Several investigators have demonstrated that gut microbiome play a pivotal role in the metabolism of carbohy- drates. Controlled dietary trials in non-diabetic humans have shown that the intake of either hydrolysis resistant starch or non-starch polysaccharides resulted to alterations in the levels of specific bacterial taxa, such as Ruminococuccus bromii, and Eubacterium rectale . Gut microbiome metabolizes complex carbohydrates and polysaccharides, collectively termed glycans, leading to production of short-chain fatty acids via fermentation . Furthermore, a breakthrough study by Thaiss et al. demonstrated that gut microbiome displays diurnal fluctuations, influenced by feeding patterns, leading to a time-specific compositional, and functional profile over the course of a day .
Insulin  resistance  is  a  major  physiopathologic  parameter for
the development of T2D. The latter is a polygenic disease displaying genetic predisposition with heterogeneous phenotypes. Indeed, in the beginning, developing insulin resistance leads to impaired insulin action, followed by hyperinsulinemia. Subse- quently, b-cell destruction ensues finally to hypo-insulinemia. T1D

is an autoimmune process leading to b-cell destruction. Viral infections have been suggested to causally participate in T1D pathophysiology, via molecular mimicry mechanisms.
A clear association between gut, and glucose metabolism disorders has emerged recently. Medications, acting on the intestinal glucose absorption, or enhancing gut hormone activity, are already extensively employed in the therapy of diabetes. Moreover, the gut demonstrates immune, and autonomous neuronal functions, playing a critical role in maintaining glucose metabolism homeostasis. Gut microbes respond to such neuro- endocrine, and immune biochemical messages influencing, in turn, the health and behavior of the host . There is a substantial amount of literature regarding the inter-relations of the gut microbiome, and glucose metabolism in health, and disease.

Gut Bacteriome, Virome, and Mycobiome in Type 1 Diabetes mellitus (T1D)

In T1D-prone adults, low diversity, and decreased bacterial loads have been observed recently . Loads of four bacterial genera exhibited quantitative differences in subjects, who were seropositive to one, or more islet autoantibodies, as compared to seronegative first-degree relatives. New-onset T1D patients, seropositive, and seronegative relatives had


decreased loads of Lactobacillus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. vs. healthy non-relatives. Further analysis unraveled trends toward increased, and reduced loads of Bacteroides, and Prevotella in seropositive subjects with respectively multiple autoantibodies, or one autoantibody . In this study, however, low bacterial diversity was demonstrated among all studied groups, probably because of their diet, and age. The authors concluded that gut dysbiosis detection is feasible in T1D-prone individuals prior to, and after T1D onset . In these patients, lactic acid-producing bacteria did not inhibit pathogen pro-oxidation metabolites, while other symbionts had a synergistic role in maintaining immune homeostasis in newly diagnosed T1D patients.
Lactobacillus secretes catalase, an enzyme with anti- oxidative capacity. In synthetic media, Lactobacillus selects, and salvages external sources of purine/pyrimidine nucleo- sides/bases, as precursors for nucleotide synthesis for its growth. In the presence of the biochemical substrates of xanthine oxidase (hypoxanthine or xanthine), microbiocidal superoxide, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are produced. Thus, Lactobacillus spp. seems to play a "supervisory" role in intestinal integrity, and ecology . Conversely, growth of Staphylococcus, a pathobiont, is inhibited in the presence of xanthine oxidase .

Bacteroides, a species whose reduction of bacterial load is implicated in obesity was increased in healthy controls . The cellular membrane of Bacteroides spp. contains sphingolipids and meso-diaminopimelic acid in its peptidoglycan layer. These molecules play a critical role in cell proliferation, and differenti- ation, immunity, inflammation, stress response, apoptosis, autophagy, necrosis, and senescence . Thus, directly, and/or indirectly they provide continuous stimuli to  the  immune  system, possibly contributing to the autoimmunity of the T1D pathogenesis, via the regulation of intestinal lumen integrity. Generally, Prevotella is associated with dietary-induced improve- ment in glucose metabolism, regulates the intestinal immune response, and protects against Bacteroides-induced glucose intol- erance . In newly diagnosed T1D patients studied, lactic acid- producing bacteria did not inhibit pathogen pro-oxidation metabolites, while other symbionts had a synergistic role in maintaining immune homeostasis . Similar findings were reported by Giongo et al. In their cohort of T1D-prone children, there was a specific pattern of gut microbiome that led to autoimmunity. This pattern included quantitative increases in a species of Bacteroides, and correlated positively with autoimmu- nity markers, as well as the deterioration of the functionality of b- cells of the pancreas. On the contrary, Firmicutes species increased in the children of the control group .
In another study, newly diagnosed T1D patients had
increased loads of the genus Bacteroides, whereas healthy controls exhibited Prevotella domination in their gut bacteriome. T1D children treated for more than two years had no statistically significant differences in Bacteroides and Prevotella counts, when compared with controls. These findings may indicate the aforementioned overstimulation of the immune system, in the newly diagnosed T1D group, due to the overabundance of Bacteroides species, and the absence of subclinical inflammation in the healthy controls, however, after insulin therapy initiation, and attainment of tight glycemic control, these differences vanished .
Murri et al. reported a significant increase in Clostridium, Bacteroides, and Veillonella, and a significant decrease in Lactoba- cillus, Bifidobacterium, Blautia coccoides/Eubacterium rectale group,

and Prevotella in children with T1D . Reduction in butyrate producing microbial communities, such as Blautia coccoides/ Eubacterium rectale, was observed in patients with other autoimmune diseases. These alterations may have a detrimen- tal effect on the gut mucosal luminal barriers, and on immune function. Increase of Bacteroides spp. is associated with the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance. Likewise, decreased loads of Prevotella spp. may have a significant contribution in the pathogenesis of T1D .
Another study in T1D patients of 5-year duration with good glycemic control, and high physical fitness, confirmed the comparability of their gut microbiota composition with those of healthy controls. A tendency in increased loads of Bacteroides, and Bifidobacterium in both, the control, and T1D groups, respectively, was reported, in contrast to the current medical literature. However, neither change was statistically significant. Thus, it seems that efficient glycemic control, and exercise  ameliorated the gut microbiota composition of T1D patients . Of note, the samples of both studies were too small to draw solid conclusions, regarding the differences observed between T1D patients with efficient glycemic control, and healthy controls .
Virome has been involved in T1D onset for a long time, and
more specifically, implicating the Enterovirus family . There is only one prospective virome study in a cohort of 19 children, before, and after the emergence of islet autoimmunity. No dramatic changes were noticed in the gut virome, either, shortly before, or after the emergence of islet autoimmunity, or after diabetes onset . The most frequently detected human viral candidate triggers of islet autoimmunity in T1D belong to the Picornaviridae family (Human parechovirus and Human entero- virus) . The presence of Human parechovirus was associat- ed with the onset of T1D . In these patients, the authors noted a prominent presence of phages, which embody most  of intestinal virome representative strains.
With respect to mycobiome, there is only one study in T1D.
It was reported that Candida spp. populations were greater in T1D, and T2D patients with poor glycemic control than in healthy controls, while no difference was found between the two diabetic groups (& ) .

Gut Bacteriome, Virome, and Mycobiome in Type 2 Diabetes (T2D)

T2D patients demonstrated low loads of Bifidobacteria longum, and Bacteroides vulgatus, but increased loads of Clostridium leptum, when compared with healthy controls . Bifidobacterium longum prevents growth of pathogenic organisms; demonstrates anti- oxidative properties via inhibition of linoleic acid peroxidation, and scavenging of free radicals; binds, and suppresses bile acid resorption; protects against colorectal cancer, and pancreatic necrosis, and preserves acidic pH in gut mucus . The main products of the anaerobic respiration of Bacteroides are acetic, isovaleric, and succinic acids. They are involved in important metabolic activities in the human colon,  including  fermentation of carbohydrates, utilization of nitrogenous substances, and biotransformation of bile acids, and steroids. Bacteroides vulgatus protects against colitis caused by E. Coli, suggesting an antagonis- tic relation between the roles of these bacteria . The decrease of Bifidobacterium longum, and Bacteroides vulgatus is accompanied by an increase of Clostridium leptum. The latter synergizes with other gut microbiota to ferment unabsorbed dietary carbohy- drates, producing short chain fatty acids, such as butyrate, a major energy source for the colonic epithelium. Thus, it influences

profoundly intestinal epithelia, while exerting anti-inflammatory effects in the gastrointestinal tract . In healthy humans, a balanced relation between Bacteroides vulgatus and Clostridia exists acting as a counter-inflammatory mechanism . This balance is compromised in T2D patients resulting to inefficient restriction of inflammation, leading, thus, to a profile of gut dysbiosis. This imbalance is aggravated by the decreased loads of Bifidobacterium, possibly contributing to T2D onset.
Larsen et al. have shown that T2D patients exhibit decreased loads of Clostridia, Firmicutes, C. coccoides-E. rectale, and Roseburia, and increased loads of Betaproteobacteria, Bacteroides/Prevotella and Lactobacilli. In the same study, loads of Prevotella, and C. leptum were slightly, but not significantly increased compared to healthy controls . The  aforementioned  microbiome  synthe-  sis has been consistently reported to cause fermentation disturbances, low-grade inflammation, and insulin resistance . Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) originates from the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, such as Betaproteobacteria, binds to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), activates pro-inflammatory signaling  pathways,  and  results  in low-grade  inflammation, thus, decreasing insulin sensitivity . In  T2D  patients,  the  ratios of Bacteroides/Prevotella and Clostridia/C. Coccoides-E. rectale loads are increased, as compared to healthy controls.

Similarly, T2D has been also associated with high Bacteroides, and Clostridium loads . In the study of Qin et al., Akkermancia municiphila, Desulfibrio, and Eggerthella loads were increased along with those of Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp. in T2D patients, when compared with healthy controls. The authors characterized this gut microbiome profile, as mildly dysbiotic. They also observed declines in loads of butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium, Eubacterium, and Anaerostipes spp., and an increase in several potential, opportunistic pathogens, such as Clostridia spp. This gut microbiome profile was characterized by increased membrane transport of sugars, increased transport of branched- chain amino acids, increased methane metabolism, increased degradation, and metabolism of xenobiotics, and reduction of sulfates. Also, bacterial chemotaxis, flagellar assembly, butyrate biosynthesis, and metabolism of cofactors, and vitamins were decreased . Interestingly, T2D patients, usually, demonstrate enhanced carbohydrate absorption, eventually due to longer villi, and thus increased intestinal absorbing surface. This villi elonga- tion could be attributed to physiologic intestinal adaptation to the acetogenic environment, caused by the Bacteroides population; this fact may result in an increased potential for intestinal gluconeo- genesis . Qin et al. did not report earlier glycemic control markers in the T2D patients they studied . In a Swedish cohort study by Karlsson et al., Roseburia, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii loads were decreased in women with T2D, confirming the conclusions of Qin et al. regarding the reduction of butyrate- producing bacteria, in the gut microbiome, despite the observed differences in the mean age of their patients .
Intervention studies, such as that of Graessler et al., showed
that three months, after a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGP) in 6 obese T2D patients, the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Cyanobacteria loads decreased, while those of Proteobacteria, Verrucobacteria,  and Fusobacteria increased. This modification  of

gut microbiome profile was associated with reductions in BMI, and arterial blood pressure, as well as total cholesterol, LDL- cholesterol, triglycerides, CRP, and serum uric acid concentra- tions. The authors suggested that this change resulted from pH changes in the gut, following RYGB, such as a decrease in gastric acid secretion, and altered bowel physiology . Also, in this case, it seems that the resulting changes in the physiology of the intestinal, and epithelial cells might contribute to the attenuation of the inflammatory processes, and to body weight loss . Interestingly, the iron-deficiency anemia observed in these RYGP-operated T2D patients, may have contributed to changes in composition of their microbiome profile due to quantitative alterations in iron transporter proteins in their gut .
Following the administration of a Chinese herbal formula,
Gemmiger, Bifidobacteria, Faecalibacterium, Lachnospiracea, and Escherichia spp. loads were increased as glucose control was ameliorated in T2D patients . Gemmiger and Faecalibacterium spp. are butyric acid-producing bacterial groups that possess anti-inflammatory properties, expressed via reduction of colonic cytokine synthesis, and increase of anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion . Oddly, members of Lachnospiracea have been reported to contribute to T2D development .
When T2D patients were treated with metformin, loads of Adlercreutzia spp. increased significantly, while those of Firmicutes spp., Eubacterium spp., and genus SMB53 of Clostridiaceae were decreased in the gut . Bacteria, such as Adlercreutzia, are capable of producing s-equol, an isoflavonoid product, which enhances insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes by increasing the expression of GLUT4, and IRS-1 via activation of PPARg. Among these bacterial products, s-equol appears to be the most relevant to human physiology . Isoflavones may function as endocrine disruptors, while the conversion of dietary isoflavones by gastrointestinal bacteria into

different metabolic compounds impacts on their biologic effec- tiveness . Eubacterium eligens produces significantly fewer polysaccharide-degrading enzymes, and more ABC transporters and carbohydrate phosphotransferase systems (PTS) than Bacteroidetes. PTS are the key signal transduction pathway involved in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism, such as glucose, in Gram-negative, and -positive bacteria. Thus, Eubacterium eligens competes with pectin-utilizing Bacteroides spp. across the pH range, probably playing a regulatory role in the immune system . Also, it seems to act beneficially on gut ecology, probably because of a post-consumption increase of polyphenol production .
The administration of transglucosidase, an enzyme, which converts starches to oligosaccharides, was associated with an increase of the Bacteroides-to-Firmicutes ratio in T2D. In contrast to previous studies, Sasaki et al. found a trend of increased Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and decreased Clostridium loads in the gut microbiome profile of T2D patients, as compared with that of a healthy control group. The main limitation in this study was the use of antidiabetic drugs, such as insulin and metformin, that may have interfered with the diversity of the gut microbiome profile .
In a recent study, a macrobiotic Ma-Pi 2 diet was implemented in T2D patients, and its impact on intestinal dysbiosis was examined. This diet consists of 40-50% whole grains, 30-40% vegetables, and 8% legumes, plus roasted ground sesame seeds with unrefined sea salt, fermented products, and seaweeds. Tannin-free green tea is the main source of liquid . Interventions employing this diet demonstrated promising results, including those of the aforementioned study . More specifically, before interven- tion, Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus, Enterobacteriaceae, Collinsella, and Streptococcus spp. loads were increased, in T2D patients. Of note, the last three species are considered pro- inflammatory. Post-intervention, the gut microbiome profile of the intervention group of T2D patients demonstrated increasing abundance of propionate, and butyrate producers (Dorea, Faecalibacterium), and a healthy-like abundance of Roseburia, Lachnospira, and Ruminococcus. In general, T2D patients are slightly depleted in fibrolytic, health-promoting commensal gut microbiome, such as the butyrate-producing Dorea, Lachnospira, Roseburia, and Faecalibacterium, and the propionate-producing Bacteroides, and Prevotella populations, essential for providing butyrate and propionate from the degradation of indigestible plant polysaccharides, and starch. There is only one study about the mycobiome of T2D, in comparison to T1D patients and healthy controls. Candida populations were more prominent in the diabetic groups than in the healthy controls, as mentioned in the previous section . This finding was attributed, either to an altered function of the immune system in diabetes, or to the increased plasma glucose concentrations. Others emphasize the interaction between the
bacteriome   and  mycobiome,   claiming   that  the  diversity of
commensal bacteria interferes with colonization through compe- tition for gut surface living space, nutrients, and the secretion of inhibitory   substances.   Consequently,   it   is   speculated   that gut dysbiosis in T2D creates the environment for fungal overgrowth.
To our knowledge, no study exists about the gut virome of T2D patients, separately, or in combination with the bacteriome (& ) .

Gut Bacteriome, Virome, and Mycobiome in Gestational Diabetes (GD)

Gut microbiome radically adjusts during pregnancy, responding to the different needs of every trimester, probably to stimulate efficient absorption of nutrients, active metabolites, or innate immunity . It was concluded that the microbial signature of pregnancy is characterized by an increase in diversity in the first trimester, and an increase in the loads of Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria . Such microbiota profiles are, either pro- inflammatory themselves, orresponding toaninflammatory signal. When specimens of third trimester gut microbiota obtained from metabolically healthy women were transferred to germ-free mice, adiposity, and insulin insensitivity ensued. This finding contrasted with the results of transferring the first trimester specimens from the same women. Remarkably, no statistically significant differ- ences in gut microbiota were observed between healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancy, and pregnant women with GD, but there was a distinctive reduction in microbial diversity in the third trimester, in both the GD, and the control group .
A recent study demonstrated that the microbiota of meconium
is altered when mothers suffer from GD. It was suggested that the microbiome of the meconium of infants born to mothers with GD was enriched with the same bacterial taxa reported in the fecal microbiome profile of GD patients, such as the Bacteroides, Parabacteroides and Lachnospiraceae, which have been repeatedly reported as predominant in T2D patients .
When overweight, insulin-resistant women, who had demon- strated in the past GD, were evaluated at eight months  postpartum, a decrease in Firmicutes, and an increase in Prevotella spp., a species that belongs to the Bacteroidetes phylum, were observed, as compared with the healthy postpartum controls . A recent, case-control study revealed several differences in microbial abundance between overweight, and obese pregnant women. When the microbiome  composition  was  evaluated  at 16 weeks of gestation among women, who did, or did not develop GDM at 28 weeks, no significant difference was noted .
There are no published studies on the virome, or mycobiome in GD. Also, there is no sufficient, or convincing evidence about an essential role of the bacteriome, in GD onset. One safe conclusion that might be drawn from the current medical literature is that GD may provide theenvironment for T2D onset later, inthe postpartum period, or later in life. Study protocols have been designed to elucidate this conundrum . One randomized, controlled trial employing a combination of dietary counseling, and probiotics, reported beneficial effects in glucose metabolism, however, there was no long-term follow-up (& ) .

Gut Bacteriome, Virome, and Mycobiome in Predia- betes (PD)

Egshatyan et al. compared the gut microbiome profile of healthy controls with that of prediabetic, and T2D adult patients. The study revealed differences not only in the gut microbiome profile between the three groups, but also in their diet patterns. Thus, the diet of the prediabetic group was more carbohydrate- enriched, than that of the T2D group. Consequently, increased loads of Bacteroides, Blautia and Serratia spp., and decreased populations of Prevotella spp., and Verrucomicrobia phylum were found in the prediabetic group, when compared with the healthy

M E T  A B O L I S M   C L I N I C A L   A N D   E X P E R I M E N T A L   7 3   ( 2 0 1 7 ) 5 2 - 6 6	61

controls . Blautia spp. are acetogenic, while certain members ferment hydrolysis-resistant starches. These species have also been associated with beneficial effects . Reduction of Verrucomicrobia species, such as Akkermancia municiphila, has been associated with reduced GLP-1 concentrations .
In another study, increased loads of Pseudonocardiaceae (Actinobacteria phylum), Megasphaera (Firmicutes phylum), and decreased loads of Saprospirae (Bacteroidetes phylum), Solibacteres (Acidobacteria phylum) and Lachnospira (Firmicutes phylum), were found in fecal samples of prediabetic, and T2D patients, when compared with healthy controls. In comparison with the T2D patients, the prediabetic group exhibited increased populations of Chloracidobacteria (Acidobacteria phylum), and decreased popula- tions of Pseudonocardiaceae (Actinobacteria phylum), Collinsella (Actinobacteria phylum), Bulleidia (Firmicutes phylum), and Enterobac- teriaceae (Proteobacteria phylum) . Actinobacteria spp. produce UDP-galactopyranose mutase , an enzyme that catalyzes



Ciubotaru et al. examined the gut microbiome of two vitamin D-deficient prediabetic groups of African American veterans: one with abnormal HbA1c (AH group) and another with abnormal HbA1c together with impaired fasting glucose (AHIFG group). The authors found higher Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria and lower Firmicutes loads, and an augmented Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio in the AH, when compared with the AHIFG group. At the class level, the Bacteroidia/Clostridia ratio was higher in the AH group. Within the class, Clostridia, Veillonellaceae, and Ruminococcaceae loads were also significantly higher in the AH, than in the AHIFG group. The authors concluded that these findings indicated that there are specific taxa associated with glycemic stability, such as Clostridia . The results of this study might be biased due to vitamin D administration .
To our knowledge, there are no studies on the virome and
mycobiome of patients with prediabetes (& ).

furanose. The latter serves as an activated carbohydrate donor for the biosynthesis of galactofuranose glycoconjugates, and acts as the epitope recognized by intelectin, an innate immu- nity protein that binds to lactoferrin, a siderophore found in extra-cellular fluids, such as mucosal secretions . In this study, the prediabetic group demonstrated decreased loads of bacteria, with the exception of Pseudonocardiaceae, and Megasphaera . The compensatory mechanism to the bacte- rial depletion is the binding of lactoferrin, granted that iron is essential for the growth of most bacteria. Megasphaera are lactate-utilizing bacteria. They convert lactate largely to acetate and propionate, and, also, to butyrate, providing substrate to the decreased bacteria of the prediabetic gut. Conversion of lactate to butyrate is one of the important factors for maintain- ing homeostasis in the ecology of the gastrointestinal tract . The observed increase in Chloracidobacteria in the prediabetic group was probably due to specimen contamination .
In gut microbiome of prediabetic subjects, lower Akkermancia
municiphila loads were found than in healthy controls, and T2D participants; lower Faecalibacterium prausnitzii loads than in healthy controls; and lower Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Collinsella populations than in T2D patients . The relative abundance of Streptococcus showed a gradual decrease from controls to prediabetic subjects, and then to T2D patients . The observed depletion of bacterial load in the prediabetic subjects may be associated with lower populations of Akkermancia municiphila, a mucin-degrading bacterium that plays a key role in maintaining the mucin layer integrity by reducing inflammation, and, thus, protecting against obesity and glucose intolerance . Faecalibacterium prausnitzii has anti-inflammatory and immuno- modulatory capacities , Collinsella characterizes gut microbiomes of atherosclerotic patients  and Haemophilus parainfluenzae is prominent in subjects with gut inflammation . Lastly, we have recently examined a small sample of prediabetic adolescents with impaired fasting glucose, who demonstrated lower Ruminococcus spp. loads. The latter is the only species that exhibited statistically significant differ- ences, while several other species exhibited the same trend, however without statistical significance, confirming earlier studies. We attributed the low bacterial loads to increased annual consumption of antibiotics till the age of three years
.

Discussion

The objective of the American Diabetes Association, and JDRF Research Symposium in 2015 was to evaluate the relations between the host, microbiome and gut ecology, regarding the metabolic, and immune systems. In addition, it aimed at defining the critical research goals needed to better understand, and to target the microbiome for the prevention, and treatment of diabetes . Indeed, the definition of functional relations among the environment, the hosts and their microbiota, could possibly lead to development of new therapies, but also with characterization of the effects of diet, and drugs on the microbiome. In this review paper, we aimed at unraveling the relations between all clinically distinct hyperglycemic states and the gut microbiome. A limitation of this review was that a meta-analysis, or even a systematic review was not applicable, because of the heterogeneity of the published human studies. Other limitations include the fact that most studies were pilot, which examined small to medium samples of middle-aged populations, and most of them failed to report baseline clinical characteristics, seemingly important for the gut microbiome, such as dietary composition, vaccination status, medications, dietary supplements, or even lipid panel reports. The strength of our review lied in the type of the studies included. Human studies were reported, because animal studies do not represent accurately the gut microbiome profiles given that they are under constant observation, and control. Furthermore, this review examined bacteriome, along with virome and mycobiome studies, newly developed microbiome subfields neglected, as yet. Also, the pitfalls of the gut microbiome scientific field have been addressed, while the need for proper terminology is underscored. Last, but not least, this review offered a perspective on Microbial Endocrinology, an indispensable field in the microbiome research, as well as other
perspectives, such as biocontrol, which is developed further on.
For the time being, there are no official terms, or specific guidelines about the terminology that should be used in this kind of studies. There are only suggestions derived from a few review papers . Furthermore, gut virome and mycobiome are two newly introduced microbiome components that have not been studied thoroughly, yet. These components might provide interconnections between the gut microbiome ecology and the pathophysiology of diabetes.

It is noteworthy that bacteriophages prevail in the human gut virome . These are viruses that infect bacteria, as they replicate in their cells. In the healthy human gut, bacteriophages are much more abundant, than animal cell viruses. Human gut virome exhibits great variability within the same, or among different individuals over time . Although the human gut typically contains bacteria from only a few phyla, the bacterial strains are mostly different between individuals. Phages seem to be vastly discriminating for different types of bacteria. Moreover, rapid within-host viral evolution has been reported . Biological control, or simply biocontrol, is a new theory that supports the application of certain microorganisms, or their products in the gut or other human organs to reduce the numbers of undesirable organisms . Thus, bacteriophages may beperceived as bacterial load controllers, and they might be used as a therapeutic means of intervention, to achieve gut normobiosis, in the future. Except for the biocontrol in the gut microbiome, human gut virome sequenc- ing may provide a sustainable picture of a disease mechanism, if different proportions of phages would be detected, along with decreased, or increased bacterial loads of specific species.
Mutualism  between  diabetic,  or  prediabetic  humans,  and
symbiotic  fungi  (mycobiome)  is frequently  overlooked,  and like

there are no studies that evaluate separately patients with hyperinsulinemia vs. those with hypo-insulinemia.
The notion that such hormones belong exclusively to the animal kingdom is false. Recent studies have established the roles of information-carrying molecules in infective, or growth pro- cesses that are not confined to host physiology. Many bacterial species possess the capacity to not only recognize neuroendocrine hormones, produced by the host in response to stress, but, also, to synthesize themselves similarly acting compounds with effects on the host. Thus, infectious microorganisms can respond directly to the neurochemical changes resulting from a stress event in a multicellular organism, and to initiate pathogenic processes. It is of importance that gut microbiota might be a source of pathology. There are several papers regarding the detrimental impact of antibiotics on the gut microbiome, but again, no study has systematically evaluated antibiotic consumption . Last, no study has systematically evaluated baseline characteristics, such as obesity, number of sexual partners, taking medications other than antidiabetic drugs, or comorbidities, such as essential hypertension, in their samples. Better study designs are needed
to address the multiple factors that shape the gut microbiome.

the virome, understudied. The fungal members of the microbiota	 	

are not numerous, compared with the bacteria. The most commonly encountered genera constituting the mycobiome are Candida, Cladosporium, and Saccharomyces. One of the most interesting characteristics of the fungi is their adaptation to environmental stress responses. Combining precise fungal char- acterization with a generalized assessment of the microbiome will expand our understanding of the involvement of the microbial environment in disease progression. The mycobiome contributes to disease through the interaction between other biomes, as well as through the interaction with the host. Several receptors on phagocytes specifically recognize the pathogen-associated mo- lecular patterns of fungi. This recognition leads to maturation, and activation of macrophages, dendritic cells, and T-cells through an antigen-presenting process. Activated T-cells differ- entiate into either Th-1 cells, which promote the phagocytosis of fungi, or Th-2 cells, which activate B-cells to release specific anti- fungal antibodies, depending on which cytokines are stimulated. Future studies characterizing the mycobiome will be helpful in understanding diabetes pathogenesis, and in developing novel preventive, and therapeutic modalities .
Most studies on T1D patients demonstrated increased
Bacteroides, and decreased Prevotella, and Lactobacillus loads. T1D patients with sufficient glycemic control seemed to have no statistically significant differences in their microbiome, in comparison with healthy controls. This finding may directly implicate the gut microbiome in T1D onset, and may indicate the establishment of inflammation, and autoimmunity in the gut .
Another aspect that needs further evaluation is the impact of stress hormones on bacterial growth . No study has examined the concentrations of stress hormones, or emotional states of the participants, by direct hormonal determination or by indirect psychologic scale evaluation, respectively, in relation to gut microbiome in T1D, T2D, GD, or prediabetes populations. The neurophysiological response of any mammal to stress involves stress-related, production of hormonal compounds, such as norepi- nephrine, epinephrine, and glucocorticoids. Also, to our knowledge,

Conclusions
There are no studies about the complications of T1D in relation to the microbiome yet. The question whether the gut microbiome is implicated in the natural history of the diabetic complications, or whether the poor glycemic control causes gut dysbiosis have not been addressed, either. Thus, more studies about T1D complica- tions, with large samples of patients are needed, targeting the gut microbiome. The T2D microbiome appears to have a different and more versatile profile than controls. In T2D patients, gut dysbiosis is seemingly characterized by the growth of acidic pathobionts, further promoting the low-grade inflammation characterizing T2D patients. Gestational diabetes, on the other hand, seems to be independent of microbiome influences, however more studies are needed to draw definite conclusions. Prediabetes is characterized by commensal bacterial load depletion, according to the latest studies, possibly depicting the start of the disequilibrium for T2D. Depending on the host age, physiology, environment, and genome, gut bacterial depletion may lead to either a temporary pro-inflammatory gut microbiome profile that starts the athero- sclerotic process, or a more stable, prolonged gut microbiome profile that leads to metabolomic abnormalities of the gut ecology, maintaining the vicious circle of obesity, and T2D. The main conclusions of this review are summarized in . Conclusively, gut microbiome research in relation to hyperglycemic disorders is very promising, as it has provided the opportunity to cover previously unknown aspects of their pathophysiology. More efficient and elegantly designed cohort studies are needed, with larger samples of patients to examine all three components of the human gut microbiome to draw definite conclusions.

Eye to the Future

Lately, there has been interest in prebiotic, probiotic, and other bioactive metabolites such as berberine administration in T1D, T2D, GD, and prediabetes. The early reports of

interventions using probiotics appear successful . No follow-up studies have been performed to evaluate their long- term efficacy however, especially in maintaining the integrity of the gut mucous, as the latter is implicated in the histologic integrity of the gut. A major target of the probiotics is, also, anti- oxidation in the gut. Normobiotic gut flora produce high levels of anti-oxidative products, maintaining the neutral pH of the human gut mucus. All these factors are in disequilibrium during gut dysbiosis, giving the opportunity to pathobionts to prosper, and to cause a major imbalance in the gut immune system, mediated via neuroendocrine factors . Lastly, studies implementing the use of bacteriophages in the regula- tion of microbiota should be performed first on animal models, as it seems that they are quite promising.
