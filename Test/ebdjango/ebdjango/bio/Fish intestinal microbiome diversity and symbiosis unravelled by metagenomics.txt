Summary
The gut microbiome of vertebrates plays an integral role in host health by stimulating development of the immune system, aiding in nutrient acquisition and outcompeting opportunistic pathogens. Development of next-generation sequencing technologies allows researchers to survey complex communities of microorganisms within the microbiome at great depth with minimal costs, resulting in a surge of studies investigating bacterial diversity of fishes. Many    of these studies have focused on the microbial structure of economically significant aquaculture species with the goal of manipulating the microbes to increase feed efficiency and decrease disease susceptibility. The unravelling of intricate host-microbe symbioses and identification of core microbiome functions is essential to our ability to use the benefits of a healthy microbiome   to our advantage in fish culture, as well as gain deeper understanding  of  bacterial roles in vertebrate health. This review aims to summarize the available knowledge on fish gastrointestinal communities obtained from metagenomics, including biases from sample processing, factors influencing assemblage structure, intestinal microbiology of important aquaculture species and description of the teleostean core microbiome.





Introduction
Nowadays, it is well accepted that the community of microbes occupying the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of ver- tebrates (gut microbiome) plays a critical role in host development, physiology and health (Mueller et al. 2012; Llewellyn et al. 2014). Most of our knowledge on micro- biome structure and function derives from studies on mammals which comprise <10% of total vertebrate diver- sity (Sullam et al. 2012). Despite encompassing nearly  half of vertebrate species (Nelson 2006), few studies have examined the gut microbiome of fishes (Llewellyn et al. 2014; Ringo et al. 2016). The first attempts  to  explore fish intestinal microbiology used culture-based methods that vastly underestimate the diversity of these communi- ties, as <10% of bacteria can be isolated and cultured under laboratory conditions (Amann et al. 1995). More recently, in line with other efforts aimed at exploring

microbial diversity in different ecosystems, molecular- based culture-independent methods have been applied to the study of microbial communities that colonize the GI tract of fishes.
There are three main strategies to characterize micro- bial communities using culture-independent methods. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) uses fluores- cent-label probes to directly observe microbes, with mini- mal processing, using fluorescence or  confocal microscopy (Amann et al. 1995). The probes target speci- fic regions of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA). This method provides a 3D view of the community and allows obser- vation of the intricate spatial relationships between microbes. Although not conducive for high-throughput sample processing, FISH has been used to track specific probiotics in the gut of fish (Del'Duca et al. 2013).
DNA fingerprinting methods have been extensively  used to compare bacterial diversity of communities



colonizing the GI tract of fish. These methods include terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (Fjell- heim et al. 2012; Green et al. 2013), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) (Le Nguyen et al. 2008; Zhou et al. 2009) and (automated) ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (RISA) (Larsen et al. 2014b). These techniques are based on targeted PCR amplification of variable regions within the ribosomal operons that are unique to bacterial species or strains. Overall, these techniques are fairly quick to perform, relatively inexpensive and allow for medium to high-throughput  analysis.  However,  results obtained with these methods are more qualitative than quantitative and, for the most part, inform on the complexity of the communities but not on the specific operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that constitute each community (DGGE allows for further analysis to identify specific OTUs, but this approach is cumbersome and has   a low throughput).
A more comprehensive culture-independent  approach  to obtain a full inventory of the diversity present in a sample is to sequence the pool of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. Bacterial taxonomy heavily relies on 16S rRNA gene sequencing which has become an accurate method  for routine bacterial identification (typically, a conserva- tive cut-off point of 97% sequence similarity or higher is used to ascribe an unknown isolate to a known species) (Rosello-Mora 2005). Early efforts involved the genera- tion of 16S clone libraries followed by sequencing of indi- vidual clones using Sanger sequencing (Clements et al. 2007; Kim et al. 2007; Wu et al. 2010b). Although very accurate in terms of sequence quality, sequencing hun- dreds of individual clones is expensive and time-consum- ing, limiting the applicability of this method. In 2008, sequencing centres started to transition from Sanger-  based sequencing to new (or next-generation) DNA tech- nologies (NGS) and the cost per megabase of DNA sequence plummeted (Wetterstrand 2016). These cost- effective technologies soon triggered an explosion of stud- ies aimed at characterizing, with a level of detail hard to imagine only a few years ago, the microbial communities present in a myriad of environments including the GI tract of fishes. This review aims at providing an overview on the knowledge generated on the fish gut microbiome using NGS technology. Studies that have investigated the gut bacterial communities of fishes are described in Table 1.


Laboratory procedures
Numerous reviews address NGS sequencing technologies, including sample preparation, sequencing chemistry and pros and cons (Metzker 2010; Mardis 2013; Chiu and Miller 2016). In this review, sample preparation protocols are briefly discussed as they affect results and data

interpretation. During design of a microbiome study, decisions regarding sample type (gut contents vs intestinal mucus), sample storage, DNA extraction method and sequencing protocols must be made, each of which may bias results. However, few studies have investigated these effects in fishes, specifically using NGS, despite the poten- tial for these biases to differ based on environmental community analysed (Tremblay et al. 2015). This section will include insight from  other  methods  and  organisms to describe potential biases related to sample processing.

Sample type
The first choice in fish gut microbiome investigations is whether to analyse digesta (gut content) or intestinal mucus (emptied intestinal tract). It is generally accepted that rinsed intestinal tissue or mucus is used to characterize adherent (autochthonous) bacteria, whereas digesta is used to characterize non-adherent (allochthonous) communities (Ringo et al. 2016). Microbiome differences between these sample types (Wu et al. 2012; Li et al. 2015; Gajardo et al. 2016) are detectable despite variations in sample processing (Carda-Di,eguez  et al.  2014;  Larsen  et al.  2014b)  which impact these communities independently. Larsen et al. (2014b) demonstrated that the influence of storage condi- tions and DNA extraction method was greater in digesta than in intestinal tissue samples.  Similarly, Carda-Di,eguez et al. (2014) determined that digesta samples were more sensitive to sampling procedures and environmental condi- tions than were intestinal samples. Thus, variation in sam- ple processing may be more impactful when investigating non-adherent bacteria than when comparing adherent microbiomes. Due to the still limited number of articles on the topic, determining sample size (i.e. number of individu- als analysed) for future studies is hard to predict. Statistical analysis using human microbiome data showed that power is a function of number of sequence reads and sample size; the more reads generated, the fewer individual replicates are needed to achieve significant levels (La Rosa et al. 2012). For most fish species, specific replicate numbers should still be determined empirically.


Sample storage
Often, field sampling prevents immediate processing of samples and sometimes even storage at -80degC, which are generally recognized as ideal storage conditions prior to DNA extraction and analysis. Choice of storage tempera- ture can significantly impact gut microbiome results.  Using RISA, Larsen et al. (2014b) demonstrated that freezing  samples  at  -20degC  for  15 days  distorted  the  bac- terial community fingerprint by decreasing apparent diversity (band number). Storage in RNAlater(r) buffer

maintained banding patterns similar to those obtained  from fresh samples, but only when used with a particular commercial DNA extraction kit. The use with another kit decreased performance (replicate similarity, diversity) in some cases, suggesting the impacts of storage conditions may be exacerbated by further downstream processing. Carda-Di,eguez  et al.  (2014)  described  a  significant  effect of  freezing  at  -80degC  on  fish  gut  microbiome  structure, in that dominant bacterial genera were shifted when compared to fresh samples. As a result, it is important to note storage conditions during between-study compar- isons on the fish gut microbiome, particularly when studying larval fish, as the effects of storage on micro- biome structure are enhanced in communities with lower diversity (Hill et al. 2016).

DNA extraction
DNA extraction protocols significantly impact results of studies on GI microbiomes (Kennedy et al. 2014; Walker et al. 2015). Bead beating influences DNA extraction, particularly as it pertains to Gram-positive bacteria (Walker et al. 2015) although its lysis efficiency  appears to be bacterial species-specific (Sergeant et al. 2012). MacKenzie et al. (2015) reported that only methods that included heat during cell lysis detected Fusobacteria in human digesta samples. This may prove vital for accurate description of the fish gut microbiome, as Fusobacteria make up a large proportion of these communities in freshwater fishes (Di Maiuta et al. 2013; Geraylou et al. 2013b; Larsen et al. 2014a; Li et al. 2015). Commercial



extraction kits optimized for inhibitor removal perform better with fish digesta and intestinal mucus samples,  likely due to the presence of PCR  inhibitors  in the  fish  GI tract (Larsen et al. 2014b). Despite these influences, baises due to extraction technique are often overshad- owed by inter-individual variation (Wu et al. 2010a; MacKenzie et al. 2015).

PCR conditions
There are nine regions identified as variable within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Yarza et al. 2014), and the V4 region, spanning from positions 751 to 1050 of the 16S rRNA of Escherichia coli, is most commonly sequenced in studies on fishes. However, other regions may be investi- gated, resulting in bias due to primer choice. Mismatches between 'universal' bacterial primers and particular taxo- nomic groups can decrease the detection of those taxa compared to those with fewer mismatches (Walker et al. 2015). Within the 454 pyrosequencing platform, Engel- brektson et al. (2010) detected greater OTU  richness  using V1-2 primers as compared to  those  targeting  the V8 region due to higher sequence variability in the V1-2 region. This variability also resulted in lower detected species evenness, as fewer sequences met the 97% identity threshold used to identify OTUs. Furthermore, sequences
<400 bp resulted in increased species richness estimates and inconsistent detection of minor community members between replicates. Even different primers designed to amplify the same region can impact bacterial community structure (Hongoh et al. 2003; Walker et al. 2015).
PCR can result in other potential biases resulting from varying initial template concentration, annealing tempera- ture and number of cycles. At higher DNA  concentra- tions or more PCR cycles, PCR products are more likely  to reanneal, resulting in reduced amplification of these products. These effects are most apparent in detecting abundances of dominant bacterial taxa (Hongoh et al. 2003). As a result, although the use of more PCR cycles may lead to increased diversity, it is likely less representa- tive of the true structure of the community. Similarly, decreasing the annealing temperature may detect greater diversity due to decreased stringency allowing for more nucleotide mismatches (Hongoh et al. 2003).


Sequencing platform
Studies using the same primers with multiple sequencing platforms suggest that there is a bias based on technology used; however, these biases are overshadowed by those demonstrated with the use of different primers. Tremblay et al. (2015) demonstrated that many of the differences between pyrosequencing and Illumina MiSeq results were

seen in poorly classified lineages and noted that these variations may have  been artefacts of  classification. Wu  et al. (2010a) investigated the differences in faecal com- munities using two different pyrosequencing platforms,
454 GS FLX and 454 Titanium, the primary difference being resulting read lengths of 260 and 450 nucleotides, respectively. Few differences were identified, and those detected may have been due to slight variations in the primers used for the two  instruments.  Fouhy  et  al. (2016) compared sequences obtained from a mock com- munity  using  Ion  TorrentTM  PGM  and  Illumina  MiSeq. The PGM platform detected a higher proportion of com- munity members than MiSeq when using V4-5 primers, but produced a profile most similar  to  that  expected  from the mock community using V1-2 primers. Interest- ingly, the differences between platforms were also depen- dent on primer selection, with V4-5 results being less variable between platforms than other primer combina- tions. Thus, despite the potential for biases resulting from choice of sequencing platform, those associated with pri- mer choice seem to be more influential.
The methods associated with fish gut microbiome studies can greatly influence their results. Many NGS technologies require PCR for target amplification prior to sequencing, and the biases associated with this  step  should be considered and standardized in fish micro- biome research to allow for accurate comparison studies. However, further technological advancements, such as single molecule real-time sequencing (Pacific BioSciences of California, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA)  that  do not rely on PCR amplification may alleviate some of these concerns.

The core gut microbiome of fishes
One of the main reasons for studying the gut  micro-  biome of fishes is the idea that those communities can be modified to improve host health. A prerequisite to this approach is the characterization  of  the  gut  microbiome of the species of interest. Many factors contribute to the composition of the gut microbiome in vertebrates includ- ing host genetics, environment and  nutrition  among others. Discovering a core microbiome, that is, members  of the microbial community present in all individuals of     a species, has been a primary goal for many researchers interested in understanding gut microbial communities (Turnbaugh et al. 2007). However, defining a core micro- biome has proven to be an elusive task in many species, including humans, as ecological relationships within each community are complex and several parameters need to   be taken into consideration such as composition, phy- logeny, persistence and connectivity (Shade and Handels- man 2012). The first study to investigate the presence of



a core gut microbiome in teleosts was conducted by Roe- selers et al. (2011). In that study, the authors  compared  the gut microbiome of wild and domesticated zebrafish and, although they found significant differences among those populations, all fish shared 21 OTUs that were con- sidered the core community. In a more recent study, the core gut microbiome of invasive carp species was com- pared between laboratory-reared and wild fish (Eichmiller et al. 2016). The authors only identified five  shared  OTUs, but they comprised up to 40% of the total OTU abundance in the samples, thus suggesting a key role for those members. While some studies point towards the environment as the primary driver for population struc- ture assembly (Eichmiller et al. 2016), others point towards nutrition or trophic level as  the  main  modifier for microbiome species composition (Liu et al. 2016). A meta-analysis on 25 16S rDNA libraries from previously published studies indicated that host trophic level, habitat and possibly host phylogeny are determinant factors for  the core gut microbiome of fishes (Sullam et al. 2012).  Not surprisingly, the study statistically demonstrated how culture-based approaches distort the  actual  composition  of gut microbial communities. An interesting result from the study was the effect that salinity has over the gut microbiome structure. While some authors have sug- gested that host phylogeny was the determinant factor in shaping those microbial communities (Roeselers et al. 2011), Sullam et al. (2012) noted that fish-associated microbiomes were more similar between  freshwater  fishes, regardless of phylogeny, than to those of fishes inhabiting marine environments. Anecdotal evidence obtained by our group agrees with the latter statement, as we have observed a dominance of Aeromonas sp. in the  gut of freshwater fishes, whereas Vibrio sp. tend to domi- nate the gut of marine fish species. It is likely that the phylogenetic  origin of the bacteria is not as relevant as  the role they play in the gut.
Overall, the fish gut microbiome seems to be domi- nated by the phylum Proteobacteria, followed by Fusobacteria and Firmicutes and in a lesser percentage Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia (see Llewellyn et al. (2014) for a summary of main phyla identified in recent studies). Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria and Firmicutes reportedly dominate  the gut microbiome  of most fish species studied to date including marine (Hennersdorf et al. 2016a) and freshwater species (Larsen et al. 2014a; Eichmiller et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2016), and they can represent up to 90% of the communities.  All these phyla are found in both  allochthonous  (transient) and autochthonous (adherent) microbial communities.
One of the most interesting species found in the gut of fishes, primarily in freshwater species, is Cetobacterium somerae of the phylum Fusobacteria. This species was first

described from children  with  late-set  autism  (Finegold  et al. 2003), and since then has been identified in a vari- ety of freshwater fishes representing as much as 94% of total OTUs (Larsen et al. 2014a; Etyemez and Balcazar 2015; Lyons et al. 2015; Gaulke et al. 2016). This species is known to produce high amounts of vitamin  B12 and  can  inhibit  the  growth  of  potential  pathogens  (Sugita  et al. 1996). Unfortunately, C. somerae is a microaerophi- lic, fastidious bacterium that is hard to culture under lab- oratory conditions but warrants further investigations on  its function in the fish gut.
The theory of a core gut microbiome has primarily been explored in humans and mammalian models (Tap et al. 2009; Turnbaugh and Gordon 2009), but many authors believe that the same concept applies to bony fish. It is likely that finding the common core microbiome of fishes will be harder than in mammals, due to the large phyloge- netic diversity of teleosts including those of aquaculture importance. To date, it is unclear whether a core micro- biome exists in all fish species or, if it does, at which phylo- genetic level. A core microbiome must be present within the fish species across environments and some studies have pointed out that environment exerts a stronger effect on  the core communities than host genetics (Wilson et al. 2008). However, several studies suggest a core microbiome exists at least at the fish species level (Roeselers et al. 2011; Hennersdorf et al. 2016a). Exploring the hypothesis that the gut microbiome is shaped by evolutionary forces dic- tated by host genetics and gut physiology, as well as by its bacterial symbionts, is definitely worth exploring. If this hypothesis is correct and a core microbiome exists, we will be one step closer to making informed decisions on how to manipulate the bacterial communities in order to promote host health and well-being in fishes.


Gut microbiome of economically significant species
Aquaculture is one of the largest and fastest growing industries worldwide. The increasing trend to develop large-scale production systems has led to intensive marine and freshwater aquaculture practices  that  are vulnerable to severe disease outbreaks. Traditional disease control methods include the use of vaccines and antibiotics to prevent and control diseases. In recent years, public pres- sure against the use of antibiotics in farm animals shifted the focus from 'killing pathogens' to 'promoting benefi- cial microbes'. As a result, many studies on the effects of prebiotics and probiotics on farm-reared fish and their associated microbiomes have been published in the last decade. Recently, the use of NGS has made possible the thorough description and characterization of the gut microbiomes of main aquaculture species and the



changes those communities exhibit when prebiotics, probiotics or other feed additives  are  incorporated  into the diet. Nevertheless, we are still in the early stages of understanding the complex interactions between the gut microbiome and its host and how the bacterial commu- nities can be most effectively manipulated to improve fish health  and  aquaculture  production   (Montalban-Arques et al. 2015).
Not surprisingly, as the top aquaculture fish group worldwide in terms of both value and tonnes produced (FAO 2016), carps have been the subject of numerous studies describing the fish GI microbiome. In general, the gut microbiome of carps is dominated by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Fusobacteria (Wu et al. 2013; Ni et al. 2014; Eichmiller et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2016; Yan et al. 2016), but their abundances often differ. Some species (Asian carp, common carp, grass carp, Prussian  carp)  have higher abundances of Bacteroidetes (Li et al. 2013, 2015; Ye et al. 2014; Kashinskaya et al. 2015) and Cyanobacteria (Wu et al. 2012; Ye et al. 2016) which is typically considered transient as ingested with food (Givens et al. 2015). The genus Cetobacterium has been recognized as a common member of the microbiome of grass, Asian, bighead, common and Crucian carps (Van Kessel et al. 2011; Ye et al. 2014; Li et al. 2015; Eichmiller et al. 2016; Yan et al. 2016) and may be  considered  a core genus among carps. In grass carp, the genera Ceto- bacterium and Aeromonas are present in large abundances throughout much of development, whereas many others such as Pseudomonas (1-4 days post-hatch, dph), Bacil- lariophyta (5-30 dph) and Bacteroides (juveniles) vary sig- nificantly by age (Yan et al. 2016). Aeromonas was also detected in relatively high abundances in Crucian and  grass carp (Li et al. 2015). Other shared taxa include Clostridium (Wu et al. 2012; Ni et al. 2014; Li et al.  2015), Veillonella,  Rothia,  and  Methylocystaceae  (Wu  et al. 2012, 2013). From these studies, it is clear  that  carps are a diverse group of fishes that harbour complex communities of bacteria; yet, there are many members of the gut microbiome that are shared across species despite studies being conducted in different environments.
Another major aquaculture species, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), has also been the subject of numerous sequencing studies. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes largely dominate the gut microbiome of this species, whether the fish are reared in freshwater or saltwater (Zarkasi et al. 2014, 2016; Gajardo et al. 2016; Schmidt et al. 2016; Dehler et al. 2017). Total OTUs range from the 100s in intestinal mucosa (Gajardo et al. 2016) to over 500 in digesta (Gajardo et al. 2016; Dehler et al. 2017). Dehler   et al. (2017) described the gut microbiome of juvenile salmon in freshwater environments to be dominated by Ruminococcaceae, Mycoplasmataceae, and Pseudomonas

sp., which were core members of the microbiome across captive and wild environments. Other studies have inves- tigated the composition of the gut bacterial communities  in  adult  (post-smolt)  salmon   in   freshwater   (Schmidt et al. 2016) and saltwater  (Zarkasi  et al.  2014;  Gajardo et al. 2016) where the fish seem to harbour different communities. Freshwater salmon harboured a gut micro- biome significantly different from that of the surrounding water, tank biofilms and gill of the fish, and were domi- nated by  Aeromonadales  and  Lactobacillales  (Schmidt  et al. 2016). Dominant genera within the Lactobacillales differed by diet but included Streptococcus and Lactobacil- lus. Both Gajardo et al. (2016) and Zarkasi et al. (2014) identified Leuconostoc and Weissella as dominant mem- bers of marine adult salmon during colder temperatures (approximately 10-12degC), whereas that  community shifted to one dominated by Vibrionaceae (Vibrio, Ali- ivibrio and Photobacterium) when waters were warmer (14-17degC; Zarkasi et al. 2014). Thus, gut communities in Atlantic salmon are dynamic and change according to season and fish growth phase, but shared taxa in different rearing environments (captive pens vs captive recirculat- ing aquaculture systems) suggest host selection may also influence these assemblages.
Another salmonid of great economic interest, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), shares a number of commu- nity members with marine Atlantic salmon, despite being  a freshwater species. For example, Proteobacteria and Fir- micutes are the dominant phyla in rainbow trout. Inter- estingly, Weissella is identified as a major member of the gut microbiome (Desai et al. 2012; Ingerslev et al. 2014a, b), as were Streptococcus, Leuconostoc (Ingerslev et al. 2014a,b) and Lactobacillus (Ingerslev et al. 2014b). Simi- lar to studies that identified these genera in Atlantic sal- mon, studies reported Streptococcus, Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus in rainbow trout in colder temperatures (10-13degC). Desai et al. (2012) performed their studies at 15degC and identified a more varied community from Atlantic salmon. These similarities suggest salmonids (rainbow trout, Atlantic salmon) share dominant mem-  bers of the Firmicutes as a core microbiome, despite dif- ferences in environment (freshwater vs marine) and diet, providing further support for a host-related selection that may be tied to phylogeny (Sullam et al. 2012).
The dominant phyla in the gut microbiome of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) are generally Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria although the relative abundances  of  these phyla vary between studies (Kohl et al. 2014; Giatsis et al. 2015; Ran et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2016). However, Standen et al. (2015) examined the allochthonous micro- biome of Nile tilapia and identified Firmicutes as the pri- mary phylum, and Zhang et al.  (2016)  identified  the  most frequent phyla to be Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes



and Proteobacteria in tilapia reared in saline water, sug- gesting these proportions are different depending on rear- ing conditions. Between-study comparisons suggest that aspects of study design largely influence lower level taxa as there are few similarities in dominant microbiome members among studies. For example, Ran et al. (2015) identified Plesiomonas as  the  dominant  OTU;  Standen  et al. (2015) identified Enterococcus, Bacillus and Strepto- phyta as common members of the microbiome; and Giat- sis et al. (2015) characterized members of the families Isophaeraceae, Peptostreptococcaceae and Bradyrhizobi- aceace, the genera Arthrobacter and Rhodococcus, and the species Mycobacterium llatzerense as dominating these communities. These differences may be due to the herbiv- orous/omnivorous nature of this species, as these trophic positions generally harbour greater diversity than those of carnivores (Larsen et al. 2014a; Givens et al. 2015; Yan   et al. 2016).


Factors influencing fish gut microbiome structure
Bacteria are everywhere, present across all habitats that other organisms call home, but the establishment of the communities formed by these ubiquitous, unicellular organisms is far from random (Sullam et al. 2012; Bakke et al. 2015; Yan et al. 2016). Studies indicate that the microbiomes of fishes, including that of the gut, are lar- gely influenced by the environment surrounding the host and diet, but overall, the gut microbiome is distinct from that of the external environment (Wu et al. 2012, 2013; Zhang et al. 2016; Dehler et al. 2017), suggesting an influence of genetic factors as well.

Environmental factors
Environmental factors such as salinity, season and geo- graphic location can heavily influence the composition of free-living and symbiotic bacterial communities (Sullam  et al. 2012; Ye et al. 2014; Zarkasi et al. 2014; Ray 2016; Zhang et al. 2016).
Variations in salinity result in substantial differences in the composition of taxa in free-living microbial communi- ties (Schmidt et al. 2015). Similarly, studies have reported significant differences in the gut microbiome of freshwater and marine fishes (Roeselers et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2016). However, understanding the influence of variables such as salinity in the wild is hampered by covariation of other environmental parameters and host taxonomy (Sul- lam et al. 2012; Schmidt et al. 2015). Fishes live in dynamic environments where conditions such as tempera- ture, hydrostatic pressure and salinity are highly variable (Zhang et al. 2016). The intestine, a major osmoregulatory organ in fishes, adapts to osmolality in seawater and is

involved in gene expression for salinity acclimation (Wong et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2016), but how these processes impact the gut microbiome is still poorly understood. Sul- lam et al. (2012) showed that the majority of fish gut communities clustered with free-living and non-fish- associated microbial assemblages inhabiting similar salin- ities as their fish host (freshwater vs marine). However,   an exception to the rule were marine herbivorous fishes that harboured gut communities more closely resembling those found  in  the  gut  of  mammalian  species.  Zhang  et al. (2016) also identified differences in the GI micro- biome of Nile tilapia acclimated to freshwater and water   at 24 psu (practical salinity units), with those reared in freshwater harbouring greater abundances of Actinobac- teria vs seawater-reared fish which harboured more Fusobacteria. These findings indicate that the bacterial communities of the gut of fishes must be adapted to tolerate the same conditions as the host organism.
Seasonal parameters also influence the gut microbiome structure in fishes. Ray (2016) identified a shift in the micro- biome of bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) where Clostridium dominated in the late summer and fall, but co-dominated with Cetobacterium in spring. Differences due to season were also apparent in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus). However, seasonal changes were greater on the skin microbiome, suggesting that the gut is able to harbour a relatively stable community composition despite seasonal influences. Zarkasi et al. (2014) also reported seasonal impacts on the gut micro- biome of Atlantic salmon (S. salar). Specifically, in winter, communities were dominated by Gram-positive fermenta- tive bacteria (i.e. Lactococcus, Weissella, Leuconostoc), whereas in summer, Gram-negative Vibrionaceae became the most abundant members of the community. Interest- ingly, come the next winter, lactic acid bacteria did not repopulate, suggesting that colonization is not only affected by seasonal factors (temperature), but also influenced by aspects of fish physiology and diet (Zarkasi et al. 2014).
Factors related to geographical location can also alter  the GI microbiome composition  in  fishes.  Microbiomes of gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) collected from Illinois, Louisiana, Indiana and Missouri clustered  together from each location but did not cluster by sam- pling month (season) (Ye et al. 2014). Interestingly, silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) were the opposite, clustering by season but not by location, indicating that factors may influence fish microbiomes in different ways. However, the authors state that these differences may reflect dietary behaviours unique to each fish  species.  This observation was also put forth by  Smith  et al.  (2015) who observed significant differences between geo- graphic locations in the bacterial communities of three- spine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) but were able to



relate those differences to prey microbiomes. These stud- ies further emphasize the difficulties in exploring these influences in wild populations.

Dietary factors
Changes in the environment such as fluctuations in oxy- gen concentration, temperature and salinity can lead to periods of starvation for fishes in the wild. Physiological changes in the host that occur during starvation force its associated gut microbiome to adapt to the new condi- tions, but few studies have characterized the changes in  the fish gut microbiome in response to starvation.  A  recent analysis of the gut microbiome of cultured Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) under starvation revealed bacte- rial communities shift, resulting in greater abundances of Bacteroidetes and fewer Betaproteobacteria in starved fish (Xia et al. 2014). Bacteroidetes, which are often dominant in the gut, produce digestive enzymes (Crawford et al. 2009), and some genera (i.e. Bacteroides) aid in digestion of polysaccharides (Xia et al. 2014). Therefore, during periods of starvation, members of the Bacteroidetes are capable of harvesting additional energy from food, pro- viding them with a competitive advantage over other  phyla and allowing for their proliferation. Likewise, Nile tilapia (O. niloticus) exhibited changes in the microbial communities of two gut regions: the colon and the cae- cum, under starvation (Kohl et al. 2014). Microbial phy- logenetic diversity increased as a result of fasting in the colon, whereas this diversity decreased in the caecum. Shifts due to reduced nutrition may  negatively  impact  fish health as members of the microbiome compete with opportunistic pathogens.
Diet is recognized as a primary factor influencing diversity and community structure of fish gut micro- biomes. The majority of studies relating diet and micro- biome composition alter diet treatments in culture or controlled settings (Desai et al. 2012; Ingerslev et al. 2014a,b; Estruch et al. 2015; Schmidt et al. 2016), as con- cern over the use of fishmeal forces aquaculturists to test new, plant protein-based formulations. As microbial communities play an important role in nutrient acquisi- tion and provide a protective barrier against  opportunis- tic pathogens (Llewellyn et al. 2014), gut microbiome manipulation is often tested as a mechanism to increase feed efficiency, growth and disease resistance of fish in aquaculture (Dimitroglou et al. 2011). Research support- ing dietary influences on the fish gut microbiome is vast and has recently been reviewed elsewhere (see Llewellyn et al. 2014; Ringo et al. 2016).
Although diet seems to clearly impact GI microbiome composition, studies on larvae have identified shifts in bacterial community structure that do not coincide with

dietary shifts, but instead with changes in larval gut phys- iology (Stephens et al. 2015). These studies provide evi- dence for another set of influential parameters on microbiome structure that include host-related genetic factors.

Evolutionary factors
Bacteria constituting the gut microbiome play a critical role in metabolic processes and are thus key components  of host evolution and fitness (Llewellyn et al. 2014; Syl- vain et al. 2016). In a world dominated by microorgan- isms, metazoans have had to evolve and form tactical associations with their unicellular neighbours in order to inhabit a wide array of niches and habitats (Rawls et al. 2006). The essential partnership between organisms and their microbes suggests the host and its associated micro- biome is best described as a single meta-organism or holobiont (Guerrero et al. 2013).
Genetic diversity of hosts, both within and among populations, is likely to impact bacterial community structure. Schmidt et al. (2015) hypothesized that fish habitat regions harbour functionally redundant bacterial taxa, and the environmental parameters associated with these habitats, including salinity, alter host physiology in   a way that forms a habitat filter which allows only  a  subset of those functionally redundant  taxa  to  colonize the host. These bacteria then compete with  one another  for the niche. Other  studies  investigating  migratory  fishes provide evidence for this hypothesis. Smith et al. (2015) found that population level differences in the composition of the gut microbiome of wild-caught three-spine sticklebacks (G. aculeatus), despite being influenced by habitat type, may be more related  to  internal sorting and selective pressures exerted  by  the  host genotype than to environmentally linked coloniza- tion processes. Similarly, Llewellyn et al. (2016) deter- mined that the gut microbiome structure of Atlantic  salmon (S. salar) was influenced by life cycle stage and not by geography. Despite migration between freshwater and marine habitats, adult salmon returning to rivers maintained many of the bacterial taxa associated with marine adults, and members of the Mycoplasmataceae were present throughout life stages. Similarly, the pres- ence of a core gut microbiome between laboratory- and cage-reared Atlantic salmon (S. salar) suggests selection  of specific microorganisms resulting from host physiol- ogy (Dehler et al. 2017). Additional evidence for genet- ics-based selection of  the  microbiome  is  demonstrated  in culture environments, as gut bacterial communities of different fish species fed similar diets exhibit species-spe- cificity, despite being reared in  the  same  environment  (Li et al. 2014, 2015). Genetic differences between fish



species and individuals can lead  to  alterations  in  immune function, metabolism and behaviour (Li et al. 2015), all of which likely influence the structure of the  fish gut microbiome. These studies indicate that the composition, diversity and structure of fish microbiomes are not simply a reflection of the environment and ecol- ogy, but are a result of pressure exerted by evolutionary relationships.
Traditionally, studies concerning the fish gut micro- biome focus on cultured fish species, particularly related  to the promotion of growth characteristics, non-patho- genic bacteria and disease control (Uchii et al. 2006). Although a symbiotic relationship exists involving the  host metabolism and bacterial communities of the gut, much is still unknown about host-microbiome interac- tions at a functional level, especially for wild fish popula- tions. A majority of research concerning host-  microbiome interactions and assembly processes derive from laboratory-based studies, often using model species that have been domesticated in laboratory settings for generations (Roeselers et al. 2011). However, the interac- tions of the gut microbiome with the host organism are complex, and these domestic studies may not adequately represent these relationships in the wild; therefore, better understanding of the natural bacterial communities of healthy individuals and how they interact with the host  and other environmental factors is of critical importance (Sullam et al. 2012; Eichmiller et al. 2016).


Conclusion and future directions
Gut microbiomes of fishes are complex, dynamic com- munities influenced by a wide variety of environmental, physiological and genetic factors. Although fish species generally harbour unique microbiomes, the exact rela- tionship of these differences to phylogeny is not yet understood. Furthermore, a large number of shared taxa persist across fish species, but it is not known whether it   is physical characteristics of the taxon itself or biological functions performed by specific members that lead to this preservation. The key to unravelling the mysteries of the microbiome lies in deciphering host-microbe interac- tions. It is important to characterize the bacterial com- munities present in fish and understand what factors influence that composition, but until we understand how those microbes influence digestion, immune function, behaviour and overall fish health, we will be unable to   use them to their full potential in aquaculture. It is important for future studies to delve deeper into func- tional aspects of the microbiome in order to advance our knowledge on fish health and microbial manipulation for disease prevention in culture systems.
