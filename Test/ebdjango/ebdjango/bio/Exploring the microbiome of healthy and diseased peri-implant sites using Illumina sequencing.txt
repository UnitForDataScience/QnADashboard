1  |  INTRODUCTION 


The widespread use of implants has led to an increase in the num- ber of cases of biofilm-mediated peri-implant diseases, particularly peri-implantitis. Although long-term longitudinal studies indicate that implant therapy presents success rates of 95%-99% (Moraschini, Poubel, Ferreira, & Barboza Edos, 2015; Vigolo, Mutinelli, Zaccaria, & Stellini, 2015), recent publications have shown a prevalence of peri-implantitis of at least 20% (Derks & Tomasi, 2015; Derks et al., 2016a,b; Mombelli, Muller, & Cionca, 2012). It has been suggested that peri-implantitis progresses in nonlinear patterns, and for the ma- jority of cases, the onset occurs within 3 years of function (Derks et al., 2016b). Peri-implantitis treatment is further complicated by the lim- ited knowledge of its microbial aetiology. While several studies have shown microbial similarities between periodontitis and peri-implantitis (Carcuac et al., 2016; Charalampakis & Belibasakis, 2015; Mombelli & Decaillet, 2011), others have implicated species not traditionally asso- ciated with periodontal/peri-implant diseases, such as Helicobacter py- lori, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus anaerobius in the aetiology of peri-implantitis (Persson & Renvert, 2014). The current poor understanding of the microbial aetiology and pathogenesis of peri-implantitis may help explain the lack of effective treatment.
Most of the publications that investigated the microbial profiles of peri-implantitis employed close-ended molecular approaches, which preclude the identification of potentially relevant taxa that are not targeted by the technique. The use of 16S rRNA Illumina sequencing can overcome this limitation by allowing an open-ended character- ization of the microbiome under study (Caporaso et al., 2012;  Frey et al., 2014; Smith & Peay, 2014), at a coverage depth 100 times greater than pyrosequencing, with a lower error rate and generating well over 10 times as many reads as 454 GS FLX (Nelson, Morrison, Benjamino, Grim, & Graf, 2014). Because it combines higher sequence quality at significantly lower cost per sequence, it has become the leading sequencing platform for human microbiome sequencing stud- ies (Amarasekara, Jayasekara, Senanayake, & Dissanayake, 2015). One limitation of 16S rRNA sequencing is that certain taxa cannot be distinguished with species-level taxonomic resolution when the commonly employed QIIME pipeline is used for the downstream taxo- nomic classification (Baker, Smith, & Cowan, 2003; Chakravorty, Helb, Burday, Connell, & Alland, 2007; Ong et al., 2013; Pei et al., 2010; Wang & Qian, 2009). To manage this limitation, we analysed the reads generated by MiSeq with HOMINGS in order to obtain species-level data. HOMINGS is an in silico probe-based platform that can detect more than 600 bacterial species from 16S rRNA reads (Belstrom et al., 2016a).
The objective of this investigation was to compare the microbi- ome of healthy (H) and diseased (P) peri-implant sites using 16S rRNA Illumina sequencing and HOMINGS and to determine the peri-implant core microbiome.
















2  |  MATERIALS AND METHODS 

 | Patient recruitment
This study was approved by  the  Ethical  Review  Committee  of  the Canton  of  Zurich,  Switzerland  (KEK-Nr:  2011-0159),  and  was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the world Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki. Peri-implantitis pa- tients were recruited as outpatients referred by private practi-  tioners for the diagnosis and treatment of peri-implant disease at  the Interdisciplinary Peri-implantitis Unit, in the Center of Dental Medicine at the University of Zurich. Patients presenting successful implants were recruited from the maintenance clinic at the same in- stitution. Potential participants were informed about the aims of the study and were assured that their participation was voluntary. All participants provided written informed consent. The inclusion crite- ria were good medical health as evidenced by the medical history, being at least 18 years old and willing to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria were as follows: periodontal or peri-implant treat- ment within the past 12 months,  systemic  antibiotics  use  within the past 6 months, pregnancy or lactation, and  heavy  smoking  (>20 cigarettes/day).
Patients allocated to the peri-implantitis group presented at least one implant with post-insertion (i.e. at least one year after loading) radiographic marginal bone loss of at least 2.0 mm mesially or dis- tally, with concomitant bleeding on probing, according to the defini- tions presented in the 6th European Workshop on Periodontology (Zitzmann & Berglundh, 2008). Radiographic bone levels were re- corded by measuring the distance from the implant shoulder to the first visible bone to implant contact at the mesial and distal aspects of each implant using periapical radiographs.
The successful implants group included implants with healthy surrounding soft and hard tissues, determined by the absence of




pus and detectable radiographic bone loss, and functional loading for at least 1 year. Gender and age were recorded, as well as plaque index (PI), bleeding on probing (BOP), suppuration (SUP), probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical bone loss (BL in mm), width of kerati- nized mucosa (KM), implant wear time, time since last check-up, implant system used and nature of reconstruction (single implant, fixed or removable). The clinical  parameters  were  measured  at  six sites per implant (mesio-, mid-, disto-buccal and mesio-, mid-, disto-lingual/palatal; except for KM, where the palatal  sites were  not measured).

 | Submucosal biofilm sample collection and nucleic acid isolation
Submucosal biofilm samples were collected from peri-implantitis sites (P) in peri-implantitis patients and from healthy peri-implant sites (H) of participants presenting successful  implants.  If  mul-  tiple implants were present in a patient, one single implant was randomly selected for sampling. Samples were obtained from the site with the deepest PPD. Prior to sampling, the supramucosal areas of the implant and suprastructure were isolated using cot-    ton rolls, air-dried and had the supramucosal biofilm removed. Submucosal biofilm samples were obtained with sterile Gracey cu- rettes (Deppeler, Rolle, Switzerland). The sample was immediately placed in a microcentrifuge tube containing 0.1 ml of RNAse-free  TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.6) and stored at
-80degC until analysis.
Bacterial nucleic acids were isolated using the Masterpure DNA purification kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA), preceded by an over- night incubation with lysozyme at 37degC. DNA quality and amount were determined using a spectrophotometer and the Picogreen dsDNA quantification assay (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

 | 16S rRNA gene sequencing with Illumina sequencing
Sample DNA was analysed by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 hypervariable region using MiSeq (Illumina,  CA),  accord- ing to the protocol described by Caporaso et al. (2011). In brief, 10-50 ng of DNA was PCR-amplified using the 341F/806R univer- sal primers targeting the V3-V4 hypervariable region: 341F (forward) AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTATGGTAATTGTCC TACGGGAGGCAGCAG; 806R (reverse) CAAGCAGAAGACGGCAT ACGAGATTCCCTTGTCTCC AGTCAGTCAGCCGGACTACHVGGGT
WTCTAAT, where the "TCCCTTGTCTCC" region represents the ap- propriate barcode sequences and the underlined bases make the PCR products Illumina sequencing compatible. PCR samples were purified using AMPure beads, and 100 ng of each barcoded library was pooled, purified and quantified using a bioanalyser and qPCR. Then, 12 pM of each library mixture spiked with 20% PhiX was loaded onto the MiSeq and sequenced. Samples that presented poor performance in the pre-sequencing PCR amplification step were amplified by multi- ple displacement  amplification  (Teles et al., 2007) using the Illustra

GenomiPhi V2 DNA Amplification kit (GE Healthcare, USA). Quality control of the reads was performed using FastQC. The paired-end reads were merged using Flash.

 | Taxonomic assignment
The reads generated using MiSeq were analysed using the QIIME pipe- line (Caporaso et al. 2010). In brief, the paired-end reads were merged using Flash. The libraries were split in QIIME according to the bar- codes used in the sequencing run, and low-quality reads were filtered out and chimeras were removed using UCHIME. Operational taxo- nomic units (OTUs) were picked using the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD) v13.2 as the reference database (Chen et al. 2010) using a 97% similarity threshold. Taxonomy was assigned using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier trained on the HOMD v13.2 database with assignments required to meet a >80% confidence threshold. The phylum- and genus-level analyses were performed using QIIME.
For species-level analyses only, we employed HOMINGS, an in sil- ico 16S rDNA probe analysis that allows for species-level identification of sequencing datasets generated with MiSeq (h g; Gomes, Berber, Kokaras, Chen, & Paster, 2015). Species-specific, 16S rRNA-based oligonucleotide "probes" were used in a Perl program based on text string search to identify the frequency of oral bacterial targets. HOMINGS comprises 671 oligonucleotide probes of 17-40 bases that target 538 individual oral bacterial species/phylotypes   or, in some cases, a few closely related taxa (Belstrom, Paster, Fiehn, Bardow, & Holmstrup, 2016; Belstrom et al., 2016a).

 | Statistical analysis
The demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population were analysed using the Fisher's exact test or Student's t test. Effects of disease status on the peri-implant microbiome were examined using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA).
Significant differences in relative abundance (%) between the clinical groups were determined at the phylum, genus and species levels. Raw read counts were rarefied to the minimum number of aligned reads. Only taxa that had at least three reads in at least three samples in both clinical groups after rarefication were considered. Significant differences between the healthy and peri-implantitis groups were determined by Wilcoxon rank sum test with FDR- adjusted p-values <.05. This rarefication and determination of signif- icance was repeated 100 times. Taxa that were significant in 95% of these iterations were further considered in the analyses. Interactions between those taxa and smoking, as well as implant type, were as- sessed using ANOVA.
The core microbiome of the dataset was determined based on taxa present with >=0.1% relative abundance in >=50% of all samples, as de- termined by HOMINGS (Abusleme et al., 2013). It was subdivided into four groups based on the taxa mean relative abundance in samples in each clinical category. Taxa that were present in >=50% of samples in either the H or P groups, but were not part of the core microbiome




considering all samples, constituted the healthy or peri-implantitis core microbiomes, respectively.

3  |  RESULTS

 | Demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects
Eighty-two patients contributing with one implant per patient were initially included in the investigation. Fifteen patients were excluded due to issues with microbial sampling. Finally, the analysis of de- mographic and clinical data from the sampled population showed that the groups comprising healthy (H, N = 32) and diseased peri- implant sites (P, N = 35) were well-balanced for age, gender, implant wear, implant location and type of restoration (Table 1). Smokers comprised 42.9% of the P group, and 21.9% of the H group respec- tively (p = .03). Straumann was the most frequently used implant

system in both groups (71.9% in H and 47.1% in P), while other sys- tems (i.e. not Straumann or Branemark) were more common in P (35.3%) than in H (3.1%; p = .003). Significant differences between the groups were observed for the clinical parameters that defined them (p < .0001).

 | Overall microbial sequencing results
Fifteen samples (seven in disease, eight in health) were excluded from analysis due to the small number of reads (<5,000). After qual- ity control, chimera depletion and noise filtering, 7,297,772 reads (median/sample: 114,230; range: 5,055-212,299) were assigned into OTUs (1.7% of them remained unassigned) and most of them (73.5%) ranged from 408 to 428 bp in length. OTUs were classified into 12 phyla: Bacteroidetes (25.3%), Proteobacteria (18.4%), Firmicutes
(16.7%),  Actinobacteria  (15.6%),  Fusobacteria  (15.6%), Spirochaetes
(5.3%), Synergistetes (0.7%), Tenericutes (0.4%), TM7 (0.3%), SR1 (0.1%),

Chloroflexi (0.01%) and GN02 (0.001%). These OTUs were further classified into 21 classes, 35 orders, 69 families and 94 genera, using QIIME. HOMINGS identified 85 genera and 210 species using species- specific "probes." A complete list of species detected in H and P sam- ples can be found in Table S1.

 | Microbial profiles of healthy and diseased peri-implant sites
Diseased peri-implant sites presented higher diversity, compared    to healthy sites (Fig. S1a). Healthy (H) and diseased (P) peri-implant sites presented distinct microbial profiles at all taxonomic levels (Figure 1a-c, Fig. S1b). Diseased peri-implant sites  were  primar- ily colonized by members of the phyla Bacteroides, Spirochetes and Synergistetes, whereas healthy peri-implant sites mostly harboured taxa from the Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria phyla (p < .05, FDR-adjusted; Figure 1a). The genera Porphyromonas (phylum Bacteroidetes), Treponema (phylum Spirochetes), Filifactor (phylum Firmicutes), Fretibacterium (phylum Synergistetes) and Tannerella (phy- lum Bacteroidetes) were abundant in peri-implantitis and were pre- sent at a higher relative abundance than those found in the H group (p < .05, FDR-adjusted). In contrast, Streptococcus (phylum Firmicutes), Veillonella (phylum Firmicutes), Rothia (phylum Actinobacteria) and Haemophilus (phylum Proteobacteria) had higher relative abundance in H sites (p < .05, FDR-adjusted; Figure 1b). Peri-implantitis sites harboured higher levels of classic pathogens (Figure 1c), such as Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola and Porphyromonas gingivalis

(p < .05, FDR-adjusted), as well as recently described new putative pathogens, such as Filifactor alocis, Fretibacterium fastidiosum and Treponema maltophilum. Implants adjacent to H sites were enriched for Rothia dentocariosa (Figure 1c).
Analysis of the relative abundance of pathogenic and health- compatible species in individual implants (Figure 2a-c) showed that red complex species (T. forsythia, P. gingivalis and T. denticola) were present at high levels in most P samples compared to H samples (Figure 2a), whereas the opposite was observed for species consid- ered compatible with periodontal/peri-implant health, such as R. den- tocariosa, Streptococcus sanguinis and Veillonella dispar (Figure 2b). Furthermore, newly proposed periodontal pathogens, such as
F. alocis, F. fastidiosum, Eubacterium saphenum and T. maltophilum and as-of-yet uncultured taxa Desulfobulbus sp ot 041, Fretibacterium  sp ot 360 and Peptostreptococcacea sp ot 091 and 369 (Figure 2c) followed a colonization pattern similar to that of well-recognized periodontal pathogens (T. forsythia, P. gingivalis and T. denticola; Figure 2b).
Next, we employed PCoA to assess the impact of peri-implant health and disease on the local microbiome. A clear distinction be- tween the microbial composition of H and P implants at all taxonomic levels was observed (Figure 3a-c). Even though it was not the primary objective of the present study, we also explored the potential impact of smoking status and implant system used on the peri-implant mi- crobiome. When the smoking status was incorporated in the analysis (Figure 3b), it became apparent that the composition of the microbi- ome of current smokers in the H microbiome was closer to that of

according to decreasing relative abundance in subjects with peri-implantitis. Only taxa that were significantly different between the healthy and peri-implantitis groups (with FDR-adjusted p-values <.05) in more than 95% of the 100 iterations performed were plotted

peri-implantitis cases than to that observed in successful implants. The impact of the implant system on the local microbiome seemed to be less evident (Figure 3c).


Because our results indicated that smoking and implant type could be possible confounders when the microbiome of peri-  implant health and disease was compared, potential interactions

between these parameters were also included in our statistical model. The results revealed an interaction between smoking and disease status for T. socranskii and Eubacterium saphenum, inter- actions between smoking and implant type for T. maltophilum and
E. saphenum, and interactions between disease status and implant type for T. maltophilum.
The commensal and pathogenic microbial profiles of H and P groups became clearer with the analysis of the peri-implant core mi- crobiome (Figure 4). Taxa typically known as host-compatible, such as Veilonella parvula, S. sanguinis and Rothia sp. were part of the peri- implant health core, while the red complex species (T. forsythia, P. gin- givalis and T. denticola), as well as "new putative pathogens" Filifactor alocis, Treponema maltophilum and Fretibacterium_fastidiosum com- prised the peri-implantitis core.
The use of HOMINGS complemented the QIIME data, as it allowed for the species-level analysis of taxa that could not be "speciated"  by QIIME. For instance, QIIME identified additional taxa from the genus Porphyromonas (Group_4) in the peri-implantitis core whereas HOMINGS classified some of them as Porphyromonas endodontalis. Similarly, it identified Campylobacter gracilis and Veillonella dispar as members of the same core, while QIIME indicated the presence of members of the genera Campylobacter (phylum Proteobacteria) and Veillonella (Figure 4, Fig. S2).
Because HOMINGS is a new bioinformatics approach for the anal- ysis of sequencing data, we compared its results with those obtained with QIIME, a more established pipeline. As QIIME does not allow complete species-level taxonomic resolution, genus-level comparisons were made. Results were quite comparable and most taxa that differed between peri-implant health and disease reported in Figure 1a-c were also observed in the QIIME pipeline (Fig. S3a-c, Table S2).


4  |  DISCUSSION 

The use of next generation sequencing to explore the microbiome  of healthy and diseased peri-implant sites allowed us to expand    the breadth of knowledge of the aetiology of this disease. We used QIIME and HOMINGS to analyse Illumina MiSeq-generated reads and


demonstrated that QIIME and HOMINGS agreed in large part at the genus level (Table S2). We showed that those pipelines should be complementary: to a certain extent QIIME provided greater breadth of classification whereas HOMINGS provided increased precision. We propose that using two accepted and complementary techniques will shed more light on the difficult (and somewhat ill-defined) classifica- tion of bacterial species.
In the present study, we were able to determine major microbial differences between peri-implant healthy and diseased sites and delin- eate the core microbiome of peri-implant health and peri-implantitis. The microbial differences between the two clinical groups were clear at all taxonomic levels. Peri-implantitis sites harboured greater levels of members of the phyla Bacteroidetes, Spirochetes, Synergistetes and Tenericutes, as well as taxa from the genera Porphyromonas, Treponema, Filifactor and Fretibacterium. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) combined with epifluorescence microscopy to analyse samples from the same individuals, Belibasakis and co-workers (Belibasakis et al., 2016) also found elevated levels of Synergistetes and Spirochetes in peri-implantitis sites. Furthermore, diseased sites were heavily col- onized by traditional pathogens, such as red complex species, as well as newly proposed pathogenic taxa (Perez-Chaparro et al., 2014), such as F. alocis, F. fastidiosum and Desulfobulbus sp. oral taxon 041, which is currently uncultured. Conversely, Streptococci were highly abundant in healthy implants. Our findings corroborate previous studies suggest- ing similarities between peri-implant associated microbiota and the periodontal microbiota. Using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization, Shibli et al. (2008) found high mean counts of all red complex species in peri-implantitis samples, while host-compatible microorganisms were reduced. Our results are also in line with early cloning and sequenc- ing studies of the peri-implant microbiome, in which Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium and Filifactor species were abundant (Da Silva et al., 2014; Koyanagi et al., 2013).
Several of the traditional pathogens as well as newly proposed pathogenic taxa were detected in overall low mean relative abun- dance levels in our study (Figures 1c and 2a,c). Albeit similar to levels reported by others (Maruyama et al., 2014), the pathogenic capacity of low level taxa might be intriguing. However, it is well accepted that the presence of taxa in low abundance does not deny their potential

The core microbiome was subdivided into four groups based on the mean relative abundance of the taxa in samples in each clinical category. Taxa that were present in >=50% of samples in a single category, but were not part of the core microbiome considering all
samples, constituted the healthy (green) or peri-implantitis (red) core microbiomes. Taxa in those core microbiomes were subgrouped based on the mean relative abundance of the taxa in samples in each clinical group. Taxa in bold were present in >=75% of all samples (Core)


importance. In fact, that is the tenet of the keystone-pathogen hy- pothesis, which holds that "certain low-abundance microbial patho- gens can orchestrate inflammatory disease by remodelling a benign microbiota into a dysbiotic one" (Hajishengallis & Lambris, 2012).
In our peri-implantitis samples, we could not confirm reports of the presence of bacteria typically detected in infections of im- planted medical devices (Mombelli & Decaillet, 2011) or species not

traditionally associated with periodontitis, including Helicobacter py- lori, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus anaerobius (Persson & Renvert, 2014), although H. influenza was part of the peri-implant core microbiome. Our results are also in contrast with those of Kumar, Mason, Brooker, and O'brien (2012). Using pyrosequenc-  ing, the authors found  that  peri-implantitis  harboured  lower  lev- els of Prevotella and Leptotrichia and higher levels of Actinomyces, Peptococcus, Campylobacter, non-mutans Streptococcus, Butyrivibrio and Streptococcus mutans than healthy implants. A subsequent paper from the same group (Dabdoub, Tsigarida, & Kumar, 2013) reported that Staphylococcus was significantly associated with implant infection and that red complex pathogens were found in only 37% of the peri- implantitis biofilms.
The discrepancies presented above may be, in part, due to the use of distinct sample collection methods. While in our study we employed curettes, several publications on the peri-implant microbiome have used paper points (Dabdoub et al., 2013; Tsigarida, Dabdoub, Nagaraja, & Kumar, 2015). However, this method has been demonstrated to harbour DNA of its own (Van Der Horst et al., 2013), which can alter the representation of the microbiome under study, particularly when sensitive sequencing platforms are used. Thus, their use has been dis- couraged, in favour of curettes (Van Der Horst et al., 2013). The above discrepancies may also be due to differences in sequencing platforms and bioinformatics pipelines. MiSeq Illumina sequencing has recently outperformed pyrosequencing, allowing an inexpensive and deeper coverage of the microbiome (Caporaso et al., 2012; Frey et al., 2014; Nelson et al., 2014; Smith & Peay, 2014). MiSeq technology has a lower error rate compared to pyrosequencing and generates over 10 times as many reads as 454 GS FLX (Nelson et al., 2014). Thus, it has become the leading sequencing platform, particularly for human microbiome sequencing studies (Amarasekara et al., 2015). Furthermore, as our goal was to define a core microbiome commonly present on implants, and those frequently associated with peri-implant health or disease only, we used a very conservative approach to assign taxa as present in our samples. For instance, taxa were removed from consideration if they did not have at least three reads in at least three samples in both the healthy and peri-implantitis groups after rarefication. The goal was to "weed out" species belonging to the so-called "rare biosphere." The idea of determining taxa consistently found in human disease condi- tions or in specific environments, the so-called core microbiome, has been adopted by many in microbial ecology (Backhed et al., 2012, Human Microbiome Project Consortium 2012; Shade & Handelsman, 2012). The use of this approach might have also contributed to differ- ences between our results and those from previous studies.
While the healthy and peri-implantitis cores were rich in health- compatible and pathogenic taxa, respectively,  we  observed  that the peri-implant microbiome core contained members of genera Fusobacterium, Parvimonas and Campylobacter. Interestingly, those genera harbour species known to be associated with periodontal inflammation (Socransky & Haffajee, 2005), such as F. nucleatum,
P. micra and C. rectus, all of which are members of the orange complex. Hence, it is plausible that implants are colonized by bacterial species that predispose the adjacent tissues to inflammation.




To obtain species-level taxonomic resolution from MiSeq sequenc- ing, we employed HOMINGS, an in silico 16S rDNA probe analysis that allows the identification of more than 600 oral bacterial species/phy- lotypes from MiSeq-generated reads (Belstrom et al., 2016a; Belstrom, Paster, et al., 2016). HOMINGS has been validated and has been in- creasingly used in oral microbiology studies (Belstrom, Holmstrup, et al., 2016; Belstrom, Paster, et al., 2016; Belstrom et al., 2016a,b; Belstrom et al., 2017; Gomes et al., 2015; McIntyre, Peacock, Akers, & Burmeister, 2016; Mougeot et al., 2016, 2017; Rudney et al., 2015; Timby et al., 2017). Yet, due to the novelty of the use of HOMINGS, we validated our findings by comparing QIIME and HOMINGS genus-level data (Table S2). The results were quite consistent, indicating the robustness of our analytical pipelines, and the validity of the HOMINGS technique.
The combination of these approaches allowed us to detect newly proposed pathogens, such as P. endododontalis, F. alocis and F. fastid- iosum and Desulfobulbus sp oral taxon 041, all with significant viru- lence properties. P. endodontalis can induce osteoclastogenesis (Ma et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2015), F. alocis and P. endodontalis present robust NOD1 and NOD2 stimulatory activity, respectively (Marchesan et al., 2016) and F. alocis has oxidative stress resistance, neutrophil and mac- rophage evasion, adhesion and invasion among its main virulence fac- tors (Aruni, Zhang, Dou, & Fletcher, 2014). In addition, transcriptional activity analysis of the periodontal microbiome and the human host in health and chronic periodontitis showed that the upregulation of bacterial chemotaxis, flagellar assembly, type III secretion system and type III CRISPR-Cas system was driven not only by the red complex pathogens, but also by candidate pathogens, including F. alocis and
F. fastidiosum (Deng, Szafranski, Jarek, Bhuju, & Wagner-Dobler, 2017). Finally, our results suggest that phylotypes, such as Desulfobulbus sp HOT 041, might also contribute to the development of peri-implantitis. Culture-independent studies have demonstrated the association of this phylotype with periodontitis (Camelo-Castillo et al., 2015; Oliveira et al., 2016); however, information on its virulence properties is scarce due to its status of "as-of-yet uncultured organism." Still, the isolation and sequencing of single cells of oral Desulfobulbus (n  =  7) identified genes associated with several categories of putative virulence factors, including chemotaxis, flagellum biosynthesis motor proteins secre- tion, iron acquisition, stress response, evasion, proteases and adhe- sion. Collectively, these findings support the pathogenic role of newly identified pathogens and that they merit further examination of their potential role as aetiologic agents of peri-implantitis.
The peri-implantitis group included more smokers than the peri- implant healthy group, which is in line with the literature, as smoking is a well-known risk factor for peri-implantitis (Heitz-Mayfield, 2008). Part of the deleterious effects of smoking on implant survival might be due to its impact on the peri-implant microbiota. As demonstrated by Tsigarida et al. (2015), smoking shapes the peri-implant microbi- ome even in clinical health, promoting a pathogen-rich community depleted of commensals. This phenomenon was also observed in the present study, where healthy implants from non-smokers had microbial profiles distinct from those found in current smokers,  which appeared to be more similar to a peri-implantitis microbiome (Figure 3a-c). This finding could help justify the differences in the

core microbiomes in peri-implant health and disease. To examine this possibility, our statistical models tested for interactions between smoking and disease status. We only found interactions between smoking and disease status for T. socranskii and E. saphenum, thereby supporting the notion that the main driver of differences in the core microbiome between peri-implant health and  peri-implantitis  was the disease status.
Due to the scarce literature on the comparison of the microbiomes of different implant systems, we also explored their impact on the local microbiome. Straumann implants were the most frequently used in both groups (Table 1), but the implant system did not seem to mod- ulate the microbial composition of peri-implant biofilms (Figure 3b,c).
Although it was not our goal to compare the peri-implant and periodontal microbiota, our results support the notion that both are similar. Using pyrosequencing, Maruyama and co-workers (Maruyama et al., 2014) performed this comparison and concluded  that  the core microbiome associated with these clinical conditions differed and suggested that they presented "different causative pathogens." However, only Prevotella nigrescens had significantly higher rela- tive abundance in peri-implantitis compared to periodontitis, while Peptostreptococcaceae [XI] [G-4], sp. HOT369 and Desulfomicrobium orale were more abundant in periodontitis. Furthermore, their PCoA did not demonstrate that the two diseases differed in their community structure. Measures of biodiversity were also similar in peri-implantitis and periodontitis. Our results were in accordance with theirs in that
P. gingivalis, T. denticola and T. socranskii were abundant and prevalent in most samples of peri-implantitis.
The present study suggests  that  the  peri-implant  microbiome is quite distinct in health and disease. Peri-implantitis sites showed an enrichment for pathogens, at the expense of a depletion of host- compatible species. Well-recognized periodontal pathogens as well as newly proposed pathogenic taxa, several of which have not yet been cultivated, were associated with peri-implant disease sites. The core peri-implant microbiome contained members of genera Fusobacterium, Parvimonas and Campylobacter sp., potentially including pathogenic species such as F. nucleatum, P. micra and C. rectus. Our findings are clinically relevant, in that based on these results, it can be postulated that close surveillance, periodic maintenance as well as early diagnosis of peri-implantitis and immediate intervention are critical for the long- term retention of implants.
