Exclusive enteral nutrition for inducing remission in inflammatory bowel disease in paediatric patients

Amit Assaa,b and Raanan Shamira,b







INTRODUCTION
For many years, enteral feeding has been used as part of the nutritional therapy of inflammatory bowel disease. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) which is defined as the provision of 100% of a person's nutritional requirements from a liquid nutritional formula either orally or via  a  feeding  tube  for 6-8 weeks, is now an established treatment for remission induction for luminal  Crohn's  disease  in children. The efficacy of EEN in induction of clinical remission has been thoroughly studied in pediatric Crohn's disease. The clinical effect of EEN have been confirmed in two meta-analyses demon- strating that EEN is as effective as corticosteroids in inducing disease remission in pediatric Crohn's dis- ease  with superior endoscopic response  irrespective of disease phenotype  EEN is now recommended as the first choice of inducing remis- sion in pediatric patients with luminal Crohn's disease .


As the introduction of antitumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) therapy for Crohn's disease, both treat- ment schemes and goals have profoundly changed with more aggressive treatment being regarded as a standard of care and aiming at deep remission as a feasible therapeutic target. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the current role of EEN in the evolving therapeutic algorithm and to provide updated evi- dence on its mechanism of action.

RECENT EVIDENCE OF EFFICACY
The role of EEN in inducing remission was primarily studied in children with Crohn's disease. Despite the fact that in the Cochrane meta-analysis from 2007, EEN was inferior to corticosteroids for inducing clinical remission in Crohn's disease patients  the cumulative evidence suggests similar clinical effi- cacy of approximately 70% and higher rates of endo- scopic response ranging from 50 to 80% compared with 20 to 30% in corticosteroids-treated patients As 'deep remission' (definedas the combination of clinical remission and mucosal healing) stands in the current center of interest as being the desired treatment target , EEN with its higher mucosal healing properties indeed immerges as a superior first-line treatment in luminal pediatric Crohn's dis- ease. In a prospective cohort of 54 with newly diag- nosed Crohn's disease whocompletedatleast 6 weeks of EEN, clinical remission [pediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI) < 10] was observed in 83%, and		biochemical	remission	[PCDAI < 10	and C-reactive protein <5 mg/dl] in 72%. Complete mucosal healing was observed in 33%, whereas near complete mucosal healing (defined as simple endo- scopic score for Crohn's disease of 1-3) in 19% [7 In a small retrospective cohort study of children with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease, children received   either  EEN  (n	10) or corticosteroids (n	18) for 8 weeks. The clinical remission rate (defined as PCDAI < 10 points) in the EEN group was significantly higher than that in corticosteroids group (90.0 vs. 50.0%, respectively, P < 0.05). Height for age z-score was higher in EEN group than that in
steroids group (P	0.026) 
In a prospective study of 90 children initiating partial enteral nutrition (PEN) (n 1/4 16), EEN (n 1/4 22), or anti-TNFa (n 1/4 52) clinical response at 8 weeks

(PCDAI reduction 15 or final PCDAI 10) was achieved by 64% on PEN, 88% EEN, and 84% anti- TNF (P 0.08). Fecal calprotectin of 250 mg/g or less was achieved with PEN in 14%, EEN 45%, and anti- TNF 62% (P 0.001). Interestingly, the anti-TNFa group did not present with more severe disease prior to therapy initiation [9
In another prospective cohort of 24 newly diag- nosed children with luminal Crohn's disease treated with either EEN (n 20) or corticosteroids (n 4), endoscopic remission (defined as simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease 0-2) was achieved in 46% but patients' outcome was not stratified between the EEN and the corticosteroids-treated groups 
Overall, and despite lack of large prospective, randomized studies, in which those assessing the mucosal response are blinded to the treatment group, there is sufficient cumulative evidence to suggest that EEN is at least comparable to cortico- steroids for inducing remission in luminal pediatric Crohn's disease. Thus, when considering the obvious superior safety profile and the probable advantage in achieving mucosal healing it should be suggested as the first option to all children and adolescents with luminal Crohn's disease.
As for reinduction with EEN during disease relapse, there is limited evidence suggesting that EEN therapy is more effective in newly diagnosed Crohn's disease patients compared with patients with long-standing Crohn's disease. Lower remis- sion rate was demonstrated after the second course of EEN (77%) when compared with the first one (92%) at 3 months with comparable relapse rates at 1 year ]. Still, response rates following second course of EEN are fair, hence, EEN should be con- sidered for reinduction of remission in previously treated children.

LONG-TERM EFFICACY
The long-term impact of a time-limited EEN induction is not well established. Mechanistically speaking it is pretentious to assume that a short therapeutic manipulation will have a significant impact in the long run. Recent studies, tried to shed light on this issue with conflicting results.
In a retrospective analysis of 89 children with Crohn's disease in ileal, colonic, and ileocolonic distribution, children received either EEN (n  43)  or corticosteroids (n 46) as remission induction therapy together with an early use of thiopurines (within 6 months from diagnosis) as maintenance therapy. Follow-up time was at least 2 years. EEN induction was associated with less linear growth failure (7 vs. 26%, P 1/4 0.02), corticosteroid depend-
ency (7 vs. 43%, P 1/4 0.002), and improved primary

sustained  response  to  infliximab  (86  vs.  68%,   P 0.02). However, corticosteroids-free remission and intestinal resection rates did not differ between groups [12
In contrast, Hradsky et al. demonstrated no difference in the duration of clinical remission in pediatric Crohn's disease patients initially treated with either EEN or corticosteroids (P 0.978). Younger  age  at   diagnosis   (hazard   ratio   0.87, P  0.016), lower height Z score (hazard ratio 0.61,  P 0.003), involvement of the upper gastrointesti- nal tract (hazard ratio 2.69, P 0.009), and elevated platelet count  at  remission  (hazard  ratio  1.004,  P 0.021) were shown to be independent predictors of early relapse.
In a recent Korean study, 66 newly diagnosed pediatric Crohn's disease patients received a poly- meric formula for 6 consecutive weeks. Clinical remission (PCDAI < 10 points) was achieved in 88% of the patients. All 58 patients with clinical remission continued with PEN (400-800 Kcal/day of formula for a subsequent 3-4 months with a reduction to 200-400 Kcal/day) for a total follow- up of 2 years. The cumulative remission rates at
1 and 2 years were 67 and 52%, respectively, suggesting that remission induction with EEN followed by maintenance with PEN is a reasonable option in compliant patients with mild-to-moderate disease ].
Overall, data suggest that induction of remission with EEN may have a modest effect on long-term outcomes, if at all.

TYPE OF FORMULA
Clinical trials used both elemental and polymeric formulae. The latest Cochrane review performed in 2007 showed that polymeric formulas were as effec- tive as elemental formulas at inducing disease remis- sion both in children and adults 
In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, children with newly  diagnosed  Crohn's  disease  (n  34)  were randomized to either elemental diet  (n 15) or polymeric formula (n  19) for 6 weeks  and were followed up for 2 years. No significant difference was recorded between the two formulae in inducing remission (93 vs. 79%, respectively) ]. These results are in concordance with former studies and meta-analysis suggesting that accord- ing to the current evidence the polymeric formula is comparable to elemental diet in inducing remission. From a statistical perspective, demonstrating supe- riority of either formula will require randomizing hundreds of patients. As such a theoretical trial does not seem feasible, clinical practice is not expected to change in the near future. Therefore, currently,

taking into account its superior palatability, poly- meric formulas should be the preferred choice in children who are using the oral (rather than the nasogastric) route.

EXCLUSIVE ENTERAL NUTRITION AS A PREOPERATIVE TREATMENT
As it is almost impossible to assess the efficacy of EEN as a preoperative treatment in children under- going intestinal resection because of the relative small numbers of operated children, the current evidence is leaning on adult data. Recent reports, imply on a substantial benefit of preoperative EEN treatment in preventing postoperative compli- cations. Patients treated with EEN preoperatively were found to have better outcome, including lower rate of stoma creation, and decreased incidence of postoperative complications including requirement for urgent operation A prospective trial of 81 adult Crohn's disease patients in which patients were either treated or not with 4 weeks of EEN prior to intestinal resection reported a dramatic improve- ment of nutritional (BMI, albumin, prealbumin, and hemoglobin) and inflammatory (C-reactive protein and Crohn's disease activity index) status in the EEN group as well as lower incidence of both infectious and noninfectious perioperative  complications. EEN therapy significantly reduced endoscopic recurrence rates after resection 6 months following operation. However, during the 2-year follow-up, incidence of clinical recurrence was similar in both groups [17

MECHANISM OF ACTION
The mechanism underlying the therapeutic response to EEN still remains obscure despite accumulating evidence of its effect on both the intestinal immune system and intestinal microbiota.
The essence of EEN involves exclusion of many common dietary components which might have a deleterious effect on intestinal permeability includ- ing epithelial barrier function. An exclusion diet has been demonstrated to induce clinical remission in 70% of treated patients, suggesting that dietary exclusion plays an important mechanistic role ].

The effect of enteral nutrition on the immune system
The effect of diet on the intestinal immune system is best assessed using cell cultures or animal models of intestinal inflammation. Few recent studies, have provided further insights on the mechanism of specific diets. For example, interleukin (IL)-10

knockout mice fed with a multifiber mix diet for    4 weeks showed attenuated disease activity which was associated with decreased lamina propria cluster of differentiation (CD4th) CD45th lymphocytes, interferon (IFN)-g/IL-17A mRNA expression, and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription (p-STAT3)/p-STAT4 expressions in colonic mucosa. Furthermore, CD4th forkhead box protein (Foxp3th) regulatory T-cells (Tregs) in the lamina propria and concentrations of total short- chain fatty acids in the cecum were markedly increased. There was also increased epithelial expression and correct localization of tight junction proteins, as well as reduced TNF-a/TNF receptor 2 mRNA expression and epithelial apoptosis ].
In another trial, heat tolerance (HT)-29 colonic epithelial cells were cocultured with TNFa in the presence or absence of polymeric formula, as used for EEN. Microarray analysis showed that poly- meric formula modulated the expression of genes involved in the nuclear factor kB pathway with consequent down regulation of IL-6 and IL-8 proteins [20It is still not clear, whether a specific component in the formula or the exclusion of dietary components drive the demonstrated attenu- ation of the nuclear factor kB cascade. HT-29 cells cocultured with TNFa and exposed to a polymeric formula containing glutamine, arginine, vitamin D3, and a-linolenic acid showed an attenuation of IL-8 production. Glutamine and arginine led to phosphorylation blockade of the signaling com- ponents in nuclear factor kB pathway and enhance- ment in nitric oxide production ].
There is accumulating evidence that micro RNAs play an important role in Crohn's disease patho- genic processes, including regulation of pro and anti-inflammatory pathways. In a human study of 25 adult Crohn's disease patients treated with EEN and 10 healthy individuals, microarray analysis showed that mucosal micro RNAs expression profile after EEN therapy was significantly changed com- pared with inflamed mucosa before treatment. Specifically, altered expressions of certain inflam- mation linked micro RNAs were corrected following treatment ].

The effect of enteral nutrition on the intestinal microbiota
EEN was shown to affect the intestinal microbial composition, promoting protective species and increased butyrate production ].  Surprisingly,  in a Scottish study of 15 children before and after successful remission induction with EEN and 21 healthy controls, the use of EEN was associated with decrease in diversity including a decrease in specific

species regarded as 'protective' as well as a decrease in butyrate in fecal samples 
A study, analyzing 117 fecal samples collected from 21 healthy controls and from 23 Crohn's disease children before, during, and after EEN treat- ment, expectedly showed lower microbial diversity in Crohn's disease compared with controls before initiation of EEN (P 0.006). During EEN, the microbial diversity of Crohn's disease children fur- ther decreased, and the community structure became even more dissimilar than that of controls. Fecal calprotectin correlated with 35 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), 14 of which accounted  for 78% of its variation. Genes involved in mem- brane transport, sulfur reduction, and nutrient bio- synthesis differed between patients and controls. Bacterial genes involved in biotin and thiamine biosynthesis decreased, whereas those involved in spermidine/ putrescine biosynthesis, or the shiki- mate pathway, increased during EEN treatment [25
In another small study, fecal microbiota of five children with Crohn's disease, before, during, and after EEN treatment was analyzed and compared with five healthy controls showing a dramatic decrease in the number of OTUs upon starting  EEN. Recurrence of inflammation corresponded with an increase in OTUs. Six families within the Firmicutes were found to correlate with disease activity during and following EEN therapy suggesting their potential role in the inflammatory process and that reduction in their abundance during EEN treatment contribute to EEN anti- inflammatory effect 
The reduced microbial diversity following EEN treatment might be partially explained by the exclu- sive intake of a homogenous diet in which many common dietary components are missing. It is plausible to assume that a less diverse diet results in a less diverse microbiome.
In  an  extension  study  of  Lee  et  al.  [9  fecal samples from patients (n 86) treated with either PEN, EEN, or anti-TNFa were analyzed using shot- gun metagenomics analysis at four points of time during treatment and compared with healthy con- trols. After 1 week of treatment the microbiota composition among the EEN-treated group drifted significantly farther from centroid of the healthy controls compared to anti-TNFa-treated patients who moved closer to the centroid.  However,  at  the end of the study, responders (those with clinical remission and reduction in fecal calprotectin) were closer to the centroid of the healthy controls than nonresponders, regardless of treatment, suggesting that at treatment initiation, the treatment modality  is the major determinant affecting gut microbiota,

whereas later on, the resolution of inflammation becomes the dominant factor. Still, the resolution of dysbiosis was not complete even among responders at 8 weeks [27
In  a  recent  trial  by  Schwerd  et  al.  [28  the possible association between EEN induced anti- inflammatory effect and changes in the intestinal microbiota was explored. In this study, peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) collected from 15 pediatric Crohn's disease patients and stimulated with bacterial ligands, secreted less prototypic inflammatory mediators IL-6, IL-8, IL-1b, and T-helper cell 1-derived IFN-g following EEN treat- ment, with no attenuation of TNF or IL-17 response. EEN was also shown to enhance the capacity of IL-10 to suppress lipopolysaccharides-induced IL-6 in PBMCs. EEN significantly increased blood FOXP3 regulatory T cells (also demonstrated by Quince et al. [25Analysis of fecal samples from eight patients showed that at 2 weeks of EEN treatment, bacterial profiles clustered significantly different from pre- EEN. EEN decreased the relative sequence abun- dance of gram-negative bacteria belonging to the phylum bacteroidetes, whereas increasing specific firmicutes species' relative sequence abundance. In contrast to other studies, Shannon diversity index was not affected by dietary intervention, whereas clinical response to EEN was linked to the relative abundance of 14 taxonomic groups [28The dem- onstrated correlation between microbial changes and the attenuation of the immune-mediated inflammatory process during EEN treatment does not clarify the order of events. Hence, the mechan- ism underlying the observed effects of EEN is yet to be discovered.

CONCLUSION
EEN is currently recommended as the first-line therapy for remission induction in pediatric luminal Crohn's disease. Despite the inconsistent evidence regarding long-term efficacy, EEN has an established advantage over corticosteroids with comparable clinical efficacy but superior mucosal healing effect as well as better safety profile. The exact mechanism by which EEN exerts its beneficial impact is still not established, particularly, whether exclusion of com- mon dietary products plays a dominant mechanistic role. Nevertheless, accumulating evidence suggest a direct anti-inflammatory effect and an effect on the intestinal microbiota. The relationships between these effects and the specific triggers for the observed changes have yet to be elucidated.
