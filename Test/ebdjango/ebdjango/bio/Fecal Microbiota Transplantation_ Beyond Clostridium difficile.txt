Abstract
Purpose of Review Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been established as standard  of care  in the treatment of antibiotic refractory Clostridium difficile infection (RCDI). This review examines the current evidence that exists to support the use of FMT in the treatment of hu- man disease beyond C. difficile infection.
Recent Findings Beneficial effects of FMT have been de- scribed in case series or small prospective trials on a wide spectrum of conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, functional gastrointestinal disorders, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, hepatic en- cephalopathy, and neuropsychiatric conditions, and in limiting antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. Each of these proposed indications for FMT  is  associated  with an underlying dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal microbiota and generally a clinical response is linked with a restora- tion of the gut microbiota.
Summary The potential of fecal microbial transplantation to alter disease course shows promise but further large- scale studies are necessary to understand limitations as well as how best to utilize this therapy.

Introduction

Less than a decade ago, fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) was in its infancy, with little evidence regarding its efficacy and safety. However, in recent years, this field has flourished; in 2016, there were over 300 peer-reviewed articles published on the topic of FMT and over 200 clinical trials involving using FMT are currently registered. FMT has become established as a highly efficacious and safe treatment method for recurrent Clostridium difficile infections (RCDI). The suc- cess of FMT in treating RCDI has prompted research into its use as a therapeutic agent for other diseases with associated gastrointestinal microbial dysbiosis. Here, we provide insight into the potential use of fecal microbial transplantation for indications other than C. difficile, including the promotion of colonization resistance against drug-resistant bacteria, and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syn- drome, and liver disease.


FMT and Colonization Resistance Against Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Colonization resistance describes the ability of the gut micro- biota to prevent infection of the gastrointestinal tract by path- ogenic bacteria. Re-establishing colonization resistance in the host gastrointestinal tract is the dominant explanation for the clinical efficacy of FMT in the treatment of RCDI. The exten- sive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in both clinical medi- cine and food production continues to propagate population-



level antibiotic resistance in enteric bacteria, posing a serious threat to human health []. Therefore, FMT is potentially a prospective therapy for decolonization of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the human gastrointestinal tract. Bilinski and col- leagues successfully decolonized 60% of subjects 1 month following FMT and 93% of subjects at 6 months []. Furthermore, our group demonstrated the efficacy of FMT in reducing the total number of antibiotic resistance genes contained in the gut microbiota of RCDI patients, results that were corroborated by Jouhten et al. [*, ]. Mahieu and col- leagues also showed the ability of FMT to decolonize the gut of vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) and carbapenemase- producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE). Interestingly, VRE was decolonized more quickly and to a greater extent than CPE []. However, the delivery of FMT via enema has not demon- strated the ability to decolonize VRE from the gut, suggesting that the route of administration represents an important factor in efficacy []. Additionally, Stalenhoef and colleagues published a case report where FMT successfully eradicated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the cause of the patient's recurrent urinary tract infections, while stool cultures remained positive for extended- spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae 3 months following FMT []. The subject of the case report had type I diabetes, presented with diabetic nephropathy, and was currently receiving peritoneal dialysis. Therefore, the failure of FMT to eradicate the ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae must be viewed in the context of a complex, immunosuppressed patient, although it does suggest the potential limitations of the therapy. Nonetheless, there is a growing body of evidence that FMT in the appropriate clinical context may be effective in decolonization of antibiotic-resistant organisms from the gastro- intestinal tract, reducing the likelihood of intra- and inter- individual spread.


FMT in Inflammatory Bowel Disease

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis suggested sig- nificant efficacy in attaining clinical remission in the most common phenotypes of inflammatory bowel disease, with 201 of 555 (36%) ulcerative colitis (UC) subjects achieving clinical remission, 42/83 (50.5%) of Crohn's disease (CD) subjects, and 5/23 (21.5%) of those with pouchitis [**]. Our systematic review and meta-analysis provided evidence that antibiotics prior to FMT were associated with improved rates of remission, and a lack of antibiotic pretreatment may explain the decreased efficacy observed in certain studies [].
Three randomized placebo-controlled trials have been con- ducted using FMT in UC. The largest, by Paramsothy et al. [**], demonstrated an increase in successful induction of re- mission using FMT. Unfortunately, two of the trials were halted at interim analysis due to presumptive futility, though one of these trials [] demonstrated a statistically significant

effect despite achieving only 58% of the planned enrollment. These results are promising, but there is at this point no evidenced-based recommendation for the use of FMT in UC. The evidence for FMT in CD is even more sparse. A prospective open-label study of CD patients who failed previ- ous medical therapy showed clinical improvement in 11/19 (58%) of patients, while 7/8 (87.5%) of the non-responders required an increase in CD medication over the course of the study [].
There are many unknowns regarding the use of FMTs in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and caution must be exercised by clinicians and basic scientists alike. It is unlikely that a single FMT will be sufficient to achieve clinical remis- sion in patients with IBD, and step-up strategy may increase efficacy and clinical remission rates []. Furthermore, the differences in the microbiota in certain individuals may change the efficacy of FMTs and must be explored in a de- tailed and scientific manner moving forward. The numerous ongoing randomized control trials using FMT in patients with IBD will hopefully provide more mechanistic insight into how best to utilize this therapy in the future for the treatment of IBD.



FMT for Other Gastrointestinal Indications

FMT has been suggested as a potential treatment for func- tional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), although evi- dence in this regard is lacking. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is an exceedingly common FGID that has few effi- cacious therapeutic options. In a single-center study using FMT, 69% subjects experienced a resolution or reduction in their IBS symptoms; however, patient-specific long- term treatment goals were only achieved in 46% of sub- jects [].
In an intention-to-treat analysis, Tian and colleagues ob- served a clinical cure for slow transit constipation (STC) in 36.7% of subjects 12 weeks following FMT, in comparison to 13.3% in the control group []. In combination with dietary fiber and probiotics, FMT resulted in clinical remission in 12/ 23 (52.5%) of STC []. Treatment of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) with FMT resulted in 44.4% of subjects regaining the ability to eat normally 8 weeks after treatment []. CIPO is a rare and extreme form of GI neuro- muscular diseases, and although a preliminary study, these results provide hope for the treatment of this condition. A single-case study indicated the relief of functional dyspepsia following single FMT via nasojejunal feeding tube in a 5- year-old boy suggesting the possible use of FMT for the treat- ment of FGID of the upper tract []. Although there are few published reports, early successes in the treatment of FGID with FMT suggest its potential.

Pushing the Limits of Fecal Microbial Transplantation

The advent of high-throughput microbial sequencing has en- abled the identification of a plethora of diseases associated with underlying GI microbiota dysbiosis. Interest has grown in the potential of microbial manipulation, including FMT, as a therapy for these disease processes which are associated with intestinal microbial dysbiosis, but were not previously associ- ated with luminal intestinal contents. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is one such process, which has a known environmental component and identified microbial dysbiosis []. Results obtained from an animal model study showed a reduction in weight gain and non-alcoholic fatty liver score (NAS) in mice treated with FMT for 8 weeks on a high-fat diet in comparison to controls []. FMT has also been investigated as a treatment of severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH), ineligible for steroid therapy. Philips and colleagues noted a resolution of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy fol- lowing FMT alongside an improved 1-year survival rate com- pared to controls (87.5% compared to 33.3%) []. In a recent study, Bajaj et al. found that FMT improved cognition and dysbiosis in patients with cirrhosis with recurrent hepatic en- cephalopathy []. Improvement in hepatic encephalopathy symptoms has also been previously noted in a case study published by Kao and colleagues [].
It is hypothesized that an altered intestinal barrier contrib- utes to the pathophysiology of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), while evidence shows FMT's ability to repair mucosal barrier function []. In two patients admitted to the intensive care unit with MODS, FMT improved their clinical course, and no recurrence of MODS was observed []. To elucidate the influence of the gut microbiota in dis- ease, results from Cui and colleagues indicated that FMT in- creased survival of mice following irradiation and may have value in the treatment for radiation-induced GI toxicity []. FMT has even reached into the field of neuropsychiatric dis- orders, in particular autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which often has co-incidental gastrointestinal symptoms []. Following FMT in children with ASD, resolution of GI symp- toms corresponded with improvements in ASD-related behav- ior. Additionally, it was observed that the microbiota of the ASD patients became more similar to that of neurotypical children following treatment []. Alterations in the gut mi- crobiota are associated with many diseases, and research into FMT as a therapy has shown promising results.


Conclusion

Understanding the benefits of FMT will prove difficult with- out explicit reporting of key components of fecal microbiota transplantation research, a notion that will enhance research in

the field of fecal microbiota transplants and provide better insight into its utility as a therapeutic agent for indications other than C. difficile infection [**]. Likewise, critical ap- praisal of the current literature needs to be performed prior to designing large randomized control trials, taking into account the most relevant findings, in order to attain results that will have an impact on the science of FMT moving forward. The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) in associa- tion with a number of other organizations has recently pro- posed the establishment of a national FMT registry to assess, amongst other aspects, the short- and long-term safety of FMT and to advance the science and medicine underlying this ther- apy [].
