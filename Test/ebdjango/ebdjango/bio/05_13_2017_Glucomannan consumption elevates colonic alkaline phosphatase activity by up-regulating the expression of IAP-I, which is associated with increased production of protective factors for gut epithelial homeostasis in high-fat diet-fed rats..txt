We previously reported that consumption of glucomannan-containing food (lily bulb) modulates gut microbiota and increases gut immunoglobulin A (IgA, index of intestinal immune function), mucins (index of intestinal barrier function), and colonic alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in rats fed a high-fat (HF) diet. Small intestinal ALP has an established protective effect in inflammatory diseases, whereas little is known about the function of colonic ALP activity. We hypothesized that dietary glucomannan would increase colonic ALP activity and the gene expression in rats fed an HF diet. To test this hypothesis, male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a diet containing 30% lard with or without 4% high or low viscous glucomannan (HGM or LGM) for 2 weeks. Dietary HGM and LGM significantly increased colonic ALP activity without affecting ALP activity in the small intestine. The colonic expression of IAP-I, an ALP gene expressed throughout the intestine, was significantly higher in the HGM and LGM groups when compared with the control group. The colonic expression of Akp3 and Alpl, other ALP genes, were not affected by HGM and LGM. Dietary HGM and LGM significantly elevated fecal levels of IgA and mucins and cecal organic acids, including n-butyrate, propionate, and lactate. Colon ALP correlated with fecal IgA, mucins, and cecal organic acids. The present study showed that dietary glucomannan elevates colonic ALP activity by up-regulation of the expression of IAP-I, which might be important for protection of gut epithelial homeostasis.

Introduction

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP, EC 3.1. 3.1) hydrolyzes a variety of phosphate monoesters into inorganic phosphate in an

alkaline environment . This enzyme is distributed in wide range of tissues, including the intestine, liver, kidney, bone, and leukocytes. Bone-specific ALP plays a role in bone mineralization . Several reports recently showed that

small intestinal ALP had a protective effect against inflam- matory diseases . Goldberg et al reported that intestinal ALP detoxified endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides) and protected from bacterial invasion . Recently, oral intestinal ALP supplementation was demonstrated to prevent metabolic syndrome in mice fed a high-fat (HF) diet . Several nutrients, such as vitamin A, K, and lactose, enhanced small intestinal ALP activity .
We previously observed that consumption of glucomannan- containing food (lily bulb) considerably increased colonic immunoglobulin A (IgA) and mucin (indices of intestinal immune and barrier functions) and modulated intestinal microflora in HF diet-fed rats, suggesting that lily bulb is beneficial for colon health . We also determined that dietary lily bulb attenuated DSS-induced colitis and elevated the colonic and fecal activity of ALP without affecting small intestinal ALP in rats fed a high fat (HF) diet . In contrast to small intestinal ALP, few studies have examined colonic ALP activity and the effects of foodstuffs on colon ALP activity. Until now, little information exists on whether food products affect colonic gene expression of ALP.
Dietary fermentable soluble fibers, including glucomannan,
elevate intestinal IgA, mucins and bifidobacteria, which are suggested to be favorable for colon health . Lily bulb contains approximately 20% glucomannan by dry  weight  ; thus, we speculate that the effect of lily bulb consumption on the colonic luminal environment is mainly due to glucomannan. In researching anti-colitis effect, a previous study showed that resistant starch, which is a fermentable carbohydrate, increased colon ALP activity in experimental animals , although the mechanism and the physiological significance of the increase in colonic ALP activity were not investigated. Taken together, we guess that the fermentable non-digestible carbohydrates similarly elevate colonic ALP activity in rats.
Therefore, based on the current literature, we hypothe-
sized that in rats fed an HF diet, dietary glucomannan would affect colonic ALP activity and gene expression as well as improve the intestinal immune and barrier functions, fer- mentation   and  microflora.   To  test   our   hypothesis, we

the powder was estimated to be 125-420 mm for HGM and 177 mm for LGM. The viscosity was more than 100 000 mPa * s for a 1% HGM solution and less than 100 mPa * s for a 3% LGM solution.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (4 weeks of age) were purchased from Japan SLC, Inc. (Hamamatsu, Japan) and maintained according to the "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals" established by Fuji Women's University and ap- proved by the ethics committee of the same university (approved no. 2015-2). The rats were  housed in  individually  in suspended cages, made of stainless  steel  (17 x 25 x 16.5 cm) with a wire screen bottom in a room with controlled temperature (23-24degC), relative humidity (55-65%), and light/ dark cycle (light, 08:00-20:00). After acclimatization with the unpurified commercial rodent powder diet (CE-2, CLEA Japan; containing 9.3% moisture, 25.1% crude protein, 4.8% crude fat, 4.2% crude fiber, 6.7% crude ash, and 50.0% nitrogen free extract; energy, 1.44 MJ per 100 g) for 4 days, the rats were assigned to three groups of 6 rats each randomized by weight. Composition of the basal diet was as follows: lard,  30%; casein, 20%; L-cystine, 0.3%; cellulose, 5.0%; sucrose, 30%;
vitamin mixture , 1.0%; salt mixture , 3.5%; choline bitartrate, 0.25%; and corn starch, 9.95% (). In the glucomannan diet, 4.0% HGM or LGM was added (). The level of dietary fiber in the HGM or LGM-supplemented diets was adjusted by reducing dietary cellulose. The animals had free access to the experimental diets and deionized water. Food intake and body weight were measured daily. Fecal pellets were collected during the last 3 days of feeding, stored at -20degC and then freeze-dried and milled. On the last day of the experimental period, the rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and euthanized. Whole blood was collected from the abdominal aorta. The serum was separated by centrifu- gation at 2000xg for 20 minutes and stored at -80degC. The cecum and liver were removed, weighed, frozen immediately with liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80degC. The small intestine and colon were removed, opened longitudinally, washed with saline to remove residual luminal contents, and weighed. Portions of the upper small intestine (3 cm from the pylorus), lower small intestine (approximately 30 cm from the  cecum),

assessed the effect of dietary glucomannan on colonic ALP	 	
activity, the gene expression, and the relationship between its activity and production or status of protective factors for gut epithelial homeostasis (fecal IgA, fecal mucins, cecal organic acids: index of gut fermentation and fecal microflora) in rats fed an HF diet.


Methods and materials

Animals and diets

Two kinds of glucomannan powder, high viscosity glucomannan "Propol A" (HGM) and low viscosity glucomannan "Rheolex LM" (LGM), were provided by Shimizu Chemical Corporation (Hiroshima, Japan). The physiochemical properties of glucomannan were analyzed by the same company. The glucomannan contents in HGM and LGM were more than 97.0% and 93.0%, respectively. The molecular weights of HGM and LGM were 1000-2000 kDa and 1.5 kDa, respectively. The particle size of



and colon were immediately immersed in RNA later (Ambion, Austin, TX), stored at 4degC overnight, and then stored at -80degC until total RNA was isolated. The remaining portions of the upper and lower small intestine and colon were frozen immediately with liquid nitrogen and stored at -80degC until subsequent analyses.

ALP activity

The mucosa of the upper and  lower  intestine  and  colon, feces, and liver were homogenized with 10 mmol/L Tris- buffered  saline  containing  1%  Triton  X-100  (pH 7.3)   and  1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF). The homog- enate was centrifuged 7000xg at 4degC for 15 minutes . The supernatant was used as an enzyme-enriched extract. Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured using a  Lab  Assay ALP kit (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan). To investigate the enzymatic properties of ALP in the colon, an inhibition experiment was performed with L-phenylalanine, L-homoarginine, and levamisole. L-Phenylalanine is a strong inhibitor of intestinal-type ALP, L-homoarginine inhibits  bone and liver-derived ALP, and levamisole inhibits tissue- nonspecific ALP . The ALP activity of pooled colonic mucosa was determined in  the  presence  of  L-phenylalanine (20 mmol/L), L-homoarginine (20 mmol/L), and   levamisole (1  mmol/L) . Protein concentration was determined using   a Qubit Protein Assay Kit and Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

RNA extraction and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)

Total RNA was extracted from the preserved experimental samples using the Nucleospin RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany), which included the elimination of genomic DNA with DNase. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using PrimeScript RT Master Mix (Takara Bio Inc, Shiga, Japan). In rats, 2 kinds of ALP isozymes were identified: intestinal ALP and tissue non-specific ALP (liver/bone/kidney, TNSALP). The Alpl gene encodes TNSALP, and the IAP-I and Akp3 (IAP-II) genes encode intestinal ALP. The IAP-I gene is expressed throughout the intestine, and the Akp3 gene is expressed specifically in the duodenum . Therefore, the cDNA for Akp3, IAP-I, and Alpl was quantified. The primer sets for Akp3 (primer ID: RA042710) and Alpl (primer ID: RA041418) were purchased from Takara Bio Inc (Shiga, Japan). The primers set for IAP-I included the following two primers: 5'-CCTGGAGCC CTACACCGACT-3' (forward) and 5'-GCCAGCGTTGAGA
CCCTTGG-3' (reverse)  .  Real-time  PCR  was  completed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Takara Bio Inc.), and samples were amplified in a Light Cycler 480 System II (Roche Applied Science) with the following cycle conditions: 95degC for 30 seconds followed by 45 cycle of 95degC for 5 seconds and 60degC for 30 seconds. Melting curve analysis was performed after amplification to distinguish the targeted PCR product from the non-targeted PCR product. The expression of the target genes IAP-I, Akp3, and Alpl were normalized to GAPDH (primer ID: RA015380 Takara Bio, Inc), which was used as an endoge- nous control gene .

Fecal IgA and mucins

Feces were suspended in 40 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 50 mmol/L EDTA 100 mg/L trypsin inhibitor and 1 mmol/L PMSF and incubated for 2 hour at 4degC. The suspensions were vigorously mixed and centri- fuged at 9000xg for 10 minutes at 4degC and the supernatants were frozen at -80degC until IgA quantitation by enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. The total IgA concentration in the feces was measured using an ELISA quantitation kit (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA) .
Mucins were extracted by the methods of Boovee- Oudenhoven et al.  with some modifications . Fecal sample was suspended in 20 volumes of PBS. The suspension was immediately heated to 95degC for 10 minutes and incubated for 90 minutes at 37degC. After centrifugation at 20 000xg for 15 minutes at 4degC, an equal volume of 0.4 mol/L acetate buffer (pH 4.75) was added to  the  supernatant  and  incubated  with 10 mL of amyloglucosidase for 20 minutes at 50degC. After the mixture was cooled, ice-cooled  absolute ethanol was  added to  a final concentration of 60% by volume. The samples were allowed to precipitate overnight at -30degC and centrifuged at 2000xg for 10 minutes at 4degC, and finally dissolved in 2 mL of PBS. Mucins were determined using a fluorimetric assay according to the method of Growther and Wetmore with N-acetylgalactosamine (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) as a standard.

Cecal organic acids

The pH of cecal digesta was measured directly using a compact pH meter (B-212, Horiba, Kyoto, Japan). Cecal organic acids were quantified using the internal standard method and HPLC (L-2130, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) system equipped with an Aminex HPX-87H ion exclusion column (7.8 mm i.d. x 30 cm, Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) attached to a micro-guard column (Cation H Cartridge, 4.6 mm i.d. x 3 cm; Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, USA) . Briefly, 500 mg of cecal digesta was homoge- nized in 5 mL of 50 mmol/L H2SO4 containing 10 mmol/L 2,2- dimethyl butyric acid (Wako Pure Chemicals Co Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) as an internal standard. Next, the mixture was centrifuged at 17000xg for 20 minutes at 2degC. The supernatant was ultrafiltered using an Amicon Ultra-4 Centrifugal Filter Device with a 3-kDa cut-off (Merck-Millipore Ltd., Tullagreen, Carrigtwohill, County Cork, Ireland), and the filtrate was analyzed by HPLC (column at 60degC) . The mobile phase (5 mmol/L H2SO4) was delivered at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min using a Hitachi pump L-2130 (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Organic acids were detected at 210 nm with a variable wavelength detector (L-2400, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) .

Fecal microbiota analysis using quantitative PCR (qPCR)

Bacterial genomic DNA was isolated from feces using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Quiagen, Limburg, Netherlands). Bacterial species were quantified by real-time qPCR using a Light Cycler 480 System II (Roche Applied Sciences) as previously described . After initial denaturation at



95degC for 30 seconds, 40 PCR cycles were done with denatur- ation at 95degC for 5 seconds, annealing at 55degC (total bacteria, Lactobacillus spp. Bifidobacterium spp., Clostridium coccoides, C leptum and Bacteroides) for 30s,  and  extension  at  72degC  for 15 seconds (Total bacteria, Lactobacillus spp. Bifidobacterium spp. and Bacteroides) or 1 minutes (C coccoides and C leptum). Melting curve analysis was performed after amplification to distinguish the targeted PCR product from the   non- targeted PCR product. Data were analyzed by the second derivative maximum method of the LightCycler 480 Basic Software. The relative abundances of the microbial popula- tions are expressed as the proportions of   total   bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using the following equation: relative quantification = 2-(Cp target-Cp total bacteria) x 100 .

Statistical analyses

Data were expressed as the means +- SEM. For data with a normal distribution, we used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Data without a normal distribution were analyzed using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test. Tukey post hoc tests were performed when a significant effect was detected using a one-way ANOVA (Body weight, food intake, colonic weight, small intestinal weight, fecal dry weight, ALP activity of small intestine and serum and cecal acetate). The Steel- Dwass post hoc test was performed when a significant effect was detected using the Kruskal-Wallis test (ALP activities of colon, feces and liver, colonic gene expression of IAP-I, Akp 3 and Alpl, fecal IgA and mucins, cecal succinate, lactate, propionate and n-butyrate and fecal microflora). Some data  were subjected to a Spearman rank correlation analysis (Rs; Spearman rank correlation coefficient). The data analysis was performed using Excel statistics 2012 software for Windows (Social Survey Research Information Co, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). P < .05 was considered statistically significant.


Results

Body weight and food intake

The final body weights did not differ among the 3 groups (). Food intake was slightly lower in the HGM group when

compared with the control group (P < .05). Colon and small intestinal tissue weights were significantly higher in the HGM group than the control group (P < .05). Fecal dry weight was significantly decreased in the HGM group (P < .05) but not the LGM group.

HGM and LGM increased colonic ALP activity without affecting the small intestine

Colonic ALP activity was markedly elevated in the HGM and LGM groups when compared with the control group (P < .05, A). Fecal ALP activity was significantly elevated by HGM and LGM intake (P < .05, B). Liver ALP activity was slightly lower in the LGM group when compared with the  control  group (). The small intestine and serum  activities  of ALP did not differ among the 3 groups (). As shown in , the colonic ALP preparations were strongly inhibited by L-phenylalanine but not L-homoarginine or levamisole.

HGM and LGM induced the gene expression of colonic IAP-I but not Akp3 or Alpl

Compared with the control group, colonic IAP-I gene expres- sion was 3.3- and 3.1-fold higher in the HGM and LGM groups, respectively (P < .05, C). The expression of Akp3 and Alpl genes did not differ among the 3 groups.  In  the  small intestine, the expression of IAP-I, Akp3, and Alpl was not affected by dietary HGM and LGM (data not shown).

HGM and LGM elevated fecal IgA, mucins and cecal lactate, propionate, and n-butyrate

Fecal IgA was significantly elevated in the HGM and LGM diet groups (P < .05, A). Fecal mucins in the HGM and LGM diet groups were significantly  higher  than  the  control  group (P < .05, B).
The pH of cecal digesta was significantly lower in both
HGM and LGM groups (5.67 +- 0.08 and 5.68 +- 0.12, respective- ly) when  compared  with  the  control  group  (7.12 +- 0.15) (P < .05). The HGM and LGM diets significantly increased the cecal levels of lactate, propionate, and n-butyrate when compared with the control diet (P < .05) (). The levels of cecal succinate and acetate were not significantly affected by the dietary manipulations.

Microflora was modulated by dietary HGM and LGM

Fecal ratio of Bifidobacterium spp. was significantly higher in the LGM group than the control group (P < .05, ), and a similar trend was observed in the HGM group. The HGM and LGM groups showed a significant decrease in the ratios of the Clostridium coccoides and C leptum when compared with the control group (P < .05). Fecal ratios of Lactobacillus spp. and Bacteroides were not affected by dietary GMs.

Colonic ALP activity significantly correlated with fecal IgA, mucins, cecal butyrate,   propionate,   and   lactate   (, P <= .01). Fecal ratios of Clostridium coccoides and C leptum were inversely correlated with colonic ALP activity (, P <= .01). The other factors of gut epithelial homeostasis did not  correlate with colonic ALP.


Discussion

We previously observed that consumption of lily bulb, which is rich in glucomannan, elevated colonic ALP activity without affecting intestinal, liver, or serum ALP activity . In accordance with our hypothesis, both HGM and LGM signif- icantly increased colonic and fecal ALP activity, whereas the ALP activities in the small intestine, liver, and serum remained unchanged. Our results suggest that the effect of

 		colonic  ALP  activity  in  rats  fed  HGM  and  LGM  may  be
associated with elevated colonic IAP-I expression. Additional

lily bulb on colonic ALP activity is mainly due to glucomannan and that consumption of glucomannan, regardless of its degree of viscosity, specifically enhances the colonic ALP activity of rats fed an HF diet.
It has not been revealed which type of ALP is elevated in the colon by fermentable carbohydrate containing diet . The inhibitory effects of L-phenylalanine, L-homoarginine, and levamisole on HGM and LGM groups demonstrated that colonic ALP was a typical intestinal ALP. Therefore, the elevation of colonic ALP activity in the HGM and LGM groups is due to an increase in intestinal type ALP.
There is little information whether fermentable carbohy- drate affects colonic gene expression of ALP. Our study revealed for the first time that dietary HGM and LGM specifically increased the colonic expression of IAP-I without affecting the expression of Akp3 and Alpl. The IAP-I gene is expressed throughout the intestine, whereas the Akp3 gene is expressed specifically in the duodenum . In the colon, Akp3 expression was approximately 1/1400 less than that of IAP-I, suggesting that the Akp3 gene does not significantly contribute to colon ALP activity. Therefore, the increase in



experiments such as Western blot analysis are now in progress to elucidate the up-regulated effects of HGM and LGM feeding on the colonic expression of IAP-I. Notably, IAP-I may play an important role in the host defense system against pathological stress .
In accordance with previous studies , fecal IgA and mucins levels were increased by dietary glucomannan. Gut IgA binds to mucins via hydrogen or disulfide bonds, and secretory IgA and mucins play significant roles in the maintenance of gut barrier functions . The present results revealed a significant correlation of colon ALP activity with fecal IgA and mucins. Zarepour et al demonstrated that mucin 2 (Muc2)-deficient mice had impaired intestinal ALP expression and LPS detoxification activity . A recent study reported that intestinal ALP improves gut barrier function by regulating tight junction protein levels . Taken together, these studies suggest that elevated colonic ALP activity induced by HGM and LGM has a strong relationship with increased gut IgA, mucin secretion, and may be related with colonic defense systems. The detailed mechanism remains unclear. Additional studies are needed to investigate the relationship between glucomannan-induced increases in colon ALP and colonic immune and barrier functions.
In accordance with a previous report , dietary HGM and
LGM elevated cecal n-butyrate and propionate. N-butyrate is utilized as an energy source in colon epithelia and modulates the proliferation, apoptosis, and activity of immune cells in the epithelial layer , which results in a lower risk of colon disease. Intestinal ALP was recently shown to be induced by butyrate in colon cancer cell lines . Higher butyrate production in the rat cecum resulted in more immune cells in the gut epithelial layer cells  and stimulated mucin production in the gut . Therefore, we assessed the relationship between cecal butyrate and colon ALP activity. The results indicated that cecal butyrate was the most correlated with colon ALP activity among cecal organic acids. Thus, the elevated production of butyrate in the HGM and LGM groups may partly relate to the increased activity of colon ALP. Thus, additional in vivo and in vitro



studies are needed to clarify whether glucomannan directly elevates colonic ALP activity or increased butyrate by glucomannan follows stimulation of the activity.
Lactate is absorbed more slowly in the gut than other organic acids , and the pH of cecal digesta is considerably lower, which favors acid-resistant bacteria such as bifidobacteria. Similar to our current study, the consumption of glucomannan modulated microbiota by increasing bifidobacteria . However, there was no correlation between colonic ALP activity and the fecal ratio of bifidobacteria. In the present study, dietary HGM and LGM significantly reduced the ratios of Clostridium coccoides and C leptum. Increase in Clostridium coccoides is associated with abdominal discomfort and bloating among patients with irritable bowel syndrome . Clostridium leptum is reported to be increased in obesity . This study provides the negative correlation between colon ALP and these ratios of Clostridium groups. These findings, when taken together, indicate that the improvement of gut microflora composition, especially the Clostridium groups, by glucomannan may be partly associated with the elevation of colonic ALP activity. Further studies in our laboratory are in progress to determine the fecal amounts of bacterial numbers, to obtain more detailed information about the composition of microflora in rats fed the HF diet with glucomannan and its relationship with colonic ALP.
There were some limitations of this study that need to be
considered. This study was conducted to test the potential effects of dietary 4.0% glucomannan. Although this dietary level is somewhat lower level of glucomannan (5.0%) in the diets of animal studies reported , the level of 4.0% glucomannan appears to be higher than those in human diets. Thus, it is necessary to conduct a study of the effects of lower levels of dietary glucomannan.
In conclusion, our study provides evidence for a novel effect of dietary glucomannan on colonic ALP activity and the gene expression of IAP-I in rats fed an HF diet. This study also indicates the relationship between colonic ALP and production or status of protective factors for gut epithelial homeostasis. We anticipated that colonic ALP activity would be important for colonic function in animals and humans, and speculate that this glucomannan effect is at least partly related to an improvement in colon health. Additional studies are now in progress to examine whether dietary glucomannan in a normal-fat diet elevates colon ALP activity and if other fermentable carbohydrates similarly affect colonic ALP.
