INTRODUCTION

Asthma is a chronic inflammation characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness, airway narrowing, mucus overproduc- tion, and airway remodeling. Airway inflammation via secre- tion of pro-inflammatory cytokines is essential for asthma de- velopment. These cytokines orchestrate allergic immune re- sponses including T cell differentiation, IgE production, and leukocyte activation.1,2 Traditionally, allergic inflammation has been considered the result of environmental allergens such as dust mites, pollens, and animal dander. However, recent stud- ies propose that bacteria-derived toxins or components can also be involved in allergic responses. Little is known about the mechanism by which environmental microbiota might con- tribute to allergic reactions.
A recent metagenomic data analysis revealed a microbiome in the respiratory tract, which was once believed to be sterile, mainly because of difficulties in culturing of the bacteria.3 Yet the airway is external to the body, and this space is thus a pri- mary site for exposure to environmental factors such as bacte- ria and viruses. Differing compositions of lung microbiota be- tween asthmatic and healthy people imply that bacteria might contribute to the development of disease.4,5 It is suggested that the local microbiota can directly affect airway-resident cells. However, the microbiota residing at other sites such as the gut

might also affect lung immune responses. Further studies might elucidate interactions between the microbiota and the immune system that contribute to asthma.
An effective immune response requires appropriate cytokines and other inflammatory mediators produced by infected or res- ident cells. Microbiota- and host-derived molecules such as ex- tracellular vesicles (EVs) might also regulate inflammation. EVs are lipid bilayers containing transmembrane proteins, cytosolic proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids with a diverse range of sizes (100-1,000 nm in diameter). As these molecules have surface li- gands that interact with receptors on target cells, they can at- tach and modify the physiological state of recipient cells.6,7 Re- cent studies have demonstrated that EVs are involved in devel- opment of cancer, atherosclerosis, diabetes, meningitis, and

salpingitis.
This review focuses on the potential relationship between en- vironmental microbiota and asthma. We are of the view that asthma is not simply induced by allergens. We also propose that EVs are key molecules that link the microbiota to asthma by regulating immune responses.

Microbiota and immune responses of asthma
Asthma is a worldwide disease commonly characterized by eosinophilic inflammation. Given the large number of eosino- phils in the airways, asthma is considered a hallmark of T help- er type 2 (Th2) disorders of the lungs. The Th2 response is gen- erally driven by the cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13, which promote increased numbers of eosinophils in the airway and lead to high IgE levels in the blood. In mice, depletion of Th2- associated cytokines or induction of the Th1 response has re- duced asthma features.8,9 However, there is an increasing inter- est in understanding the non-Th2 response, which likely repre- sents a large proportion of asthma cases.
The non-Th2 response involves adult-onset and severe asth- ma, which have a mixed Th1 and Th17 response with neutro- philic inflammation.10,11 In mice models of asthma, IL-17 has been strongly linked to neutrophilic inflammation, and has led to corticosteroid resistance.12,13 Severe asthma driven by IL-17 pathologically correlated with steroid-resistant asthma. Neu- trophilic asthma has been linked to upregulation in TNF-a pathways, but it remains uncertain whether TNF blockade could improve steroid responsiveness.14,15 Although 2 forms of asthma have been defined, Th2 and non-Th2 responses co-oc- cur in many cases, rather than being mutually exclusive.
Similar to many chronic inflammatory diseases, the patho- genesis of asthma mainly depends on genetic susceptibility and environmental factors.16-18 Environmental changes are a major factor in the development of allergic diseases. The recent mi- crobiota hypothesis has suggested that perturbations in the gut microbiota disrupt the mucosal tolerance.19,20 A balance be- tween the microbiota and host that maintains functional ho- meostasis is accurately regulated; however, it is constantly chal- lenged by several factors. Once pathogenic bacteria colonize a niche, they cause a state of dysbiosis in the microbial commu- nity, which is now recognized to induce allergic diseases such as asthma (Table).

Airway microbiota and asthma
The presence of certain bacteria in the airway can regulate al- lergic inflammation.21 Haemophilus influenzae might be related to neutrophilic asthma, in which inflammation is mainly in- duced by neutrophils.22 Another well-known pathogenic bacte- rium, Staphylococcus aureus, is thought to be involved in severe asthma, since asthmatic patients have presented high levels of specific antibodies against S. aureus enterotoxins.23,24 Other bacteria such as Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneu-

moniae have also been associated with childhood asthma.25 However, not all bacteria in the airway aggravate the severity of asthma; for example, Lactobacillus rhamnosus has protective effects against respiratory infection.26 Specific bacteria seem to modulate allergic inflammation; however, whether a single bacterial species can induce allergic disease is still unclear.
Recent studies have revealed that the composition of the mi- crobiota residing in the lung can be more important in allergic diseases than the simple presence of individual species. Analy- ses of 16S rRNA have found that the airway hosts a complex community of microbes; moreover, bacterial populations of asthmatic patients are unlike those of healthy control sub- jects.27,28 The bacterial compositions of bronchial samples have also exhibited differences between 2 groups.29,30 These reports indicate that the phylum Proteobacteria was relatively prevalent in asthmatics, while phylum Bacteroidetes predominated in healthy controls. It has become clear that microbial community dysbiosis correlates with asthma.31,32 Diverse bacterial commu- nities reside in the airway, and altered composition of these mi- crobiota might contribute to allergic inflammation in asthma.
Clinical studies of corticosteroid inhalation suggest that the airway microbiota affects corticosteroid responsiveness among asthmatic patients.33 Bacterial community profiles of corticoste- roid-sensitive or -resistant asthmatics were not well discerned, but Haemophilus parainfluenzae was observed in some of the corticosteroid-resistant asthmatics. Another study of antibiotic treatment observed azithromycin-induced modification of the airway microbiota of adult asthmatic patients.34 The abundance of members of the Haemophilus and Pseudomonas genera de-



clined within the community, but the abundance of Anaerococ- cus species increased. These findings suggest that the airway microbiota drives asthma development, and explain corticoste- roid responsiveness. We expect that current efforts to under- stand the airway microbiome membership in detail will help reveal a mechanistic link between the microbiota and asthma.

Gut microbiota and asthma
The airway microbiota can shape lung-specific immune re- sponses resulting in either homeostatic or detrimental inflam- mation. Recently, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract microbiome has also become a plausible influencer of immune develop- ment against allergy or asthma. This interest in GI microbes stemmed from an observed inverse relationship between rate of childhood asthma and exposure to bacteria in infancy.35-38 Moreover, infants who develop asthma have presented relative- ly few lactobacillus, and bifidobacteria, and relatively many en- terococcus.39-41 Further studies indicate that the gut microbiota influences the maturation of immune function in early life through the oral ingestion of environmental bacteria.42-44
Studies in mice also provide strong evidence of the role of gut microbiota in the regulation of immune function. Germ-free (GF) mice presented strong allergic inflammation compared to specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice through OVA sensitization and challenge.45 Specific bacteria like Lactobacillus reuteri ex- hibited the protective effects of inducing regulatory T (Treg) cell expansion and reducing inflammation, in response to OVA challenge in sensitized BALB/c mice.46 Treatment with Clostrid- ium strains produced similar effects on Treg cells in the colonic mucosa, and reduced IgE levels after OVA sensitization.47 Inter- estingly, segmented filamentous bacteria induced Th17 cell ex- pansion, which mediates mucosal defense in the lamina pro- pria.48 However, a recent study found that direct ingestion of certain bacteria was insufficient to induce significant changes in immune function.
Experimental feeding of different dietary components indi- cated that dietary changes could affect allergic inflammation by modifying the microbiota composition. High fiber diet altered the ratio of Firmicutes spp. to Bacteroidetes spp., and increased the levels of circulating short-chain fatty acids. These subse- quent alterations protected against allergic lung inflammation via activation of Treg cells.49,50 The mechanisms of Treg-medi- ated suppression are not fully understood, but microbes do promote Treg cell activation by maintaining resident dendritic cells (DCs) in an immature state, which is essential for mucosal tolerance.51,52
The propensity of an innocuous antigen to induce local and systemic immune unresponsiveness is termed as oral toler- ance.53 In the large intestine, commensal bacteria are also regu- lated by an analogous, but more locally processed, tolerance. It is assumed that oral tolerance and airway tolerance are tightly linked, and that the GI tract might act as asensor for the develop-

ment of tolerance to antigens. However, it remains to be deter- mined how changes in the gut microbiota affect lung immunity.

EVs as mediators of allergic disease
Immune system recognition of pathogens is essential to acti- vating immune cells. Bacterial components that trigger im- mune response are often referred to as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs); these components include carbo- hydrates, lipids, proteins, and genetic material. PAMPs can bind to pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on immune and non- immune cells, thereby initiating signaling cascades. Given their role in the immune system, pathogens have evolved to increase their virulence by modulating their signals to PRRs.54 Recent studies report that both PAMPs and EVs released from infected cells and pathogens are likely to be involved in immune re- sponses.55
EVs are released by diverse cell types that have been implicat- ed in allergic responses such as bronchial epithelial cells, mast cells, dendritic cells, and T cells in the lung.56 Bronchial epithe- lial cells are the primary producers of EVs in the lungs of pa- tients with asthma.57 Interestingly, it was found that IL-13-stim- ulated bronchial epithelial cells released EVs that promoted proliferation of macrophages, but reduction in EV secretion seemed to ameliorate asthmatic features. During allergic in- flammation, mast cell-derived EVs were highly activated, and contributed to induction of DC maturation.58 DCs also produce EVs that present allergens and activate allergen-specific Th2 cells.59 Many studies suggest that EVs can transfer MHC/anti- gen complexes, enabling the DCs to efficiently activate T cells.60,61 These observations indicate the potential contribu- tions of diversely sourced EVs to the pathogenesis of asthma. In contrast, some studies have reported that EVs can inhibit Th2 response-associated cytokine production, IgE response, and even prevent the development of asthma.62 While immune cells mediate immune responses, non-immune cells such as bacte- ria also have important roles in activating immune responses. EVs produced by pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus have been implicated in atopic dermatitis-like skin inflamma- tion;63,64 these EVs might also induce neutrophilic pulmonary inflammation.65 EVs derived from E. coli induce several infec- tious diseases, and can aggravate emphysema through IL-17A- mediated neutrophilic inflammation.66 Pseudomonas aerugino- sa often contributes to lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, and its EVs increase pulmonary inflammation through Toll-like re- ceptor (TLR)2 and TLR4 pathways.67 Moreover, indoor dust, which contains many components of bacteria, has been associ- ated with both Th1 and Th17 responses, which induce neutro- philic pulmonary inflammation.68,69 As bacteria-derived EVs can affect distal host cell sites,70 these vesicles might play signif- icant roles throughout the body. Here, we propose a model that uses EVs to link the environmental microbiota with airway im- munity (Figure).

CONCLUSIONS

The presence of lung and gut dysbiosis in asthma suggests that microbiota composition might shape the immune system and lead to the development of asthma. Microbial communi- ties have immunomodulatory roles in both the disease progres- sion and the clinical outcome of asthma, but our understand- ing of mechanisms linking gut- to lung-immunity is still un- clear. EVs might provide new insights into immune responses, as they can move to distant sites and stimulate other cells such as immune and epithelial cells. EVs produced by commensal bacteria can benefit the host by promoting mucosal tolerance and protecting against the onset of diseases. However, ques- tions remain as to which components of EVs activate recipient cells and how EVs regulate intracellular signaling pathways. Further studies will provide a mechanistic understanding of in- teractions between the microbiota and the host immune re- sponse through EVs, which in turn will aid in providing new in-

sights into the management of asthma.
