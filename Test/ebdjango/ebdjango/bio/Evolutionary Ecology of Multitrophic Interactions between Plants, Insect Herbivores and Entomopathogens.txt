Abstract Plants play an important role in the interactions between insect herbivores and their pathogens. Since the seminal review by Cory and Hoover () on plant- mediated effects on insect-pathogen interactions, consider- able progress has been made in understanding the complexity of these tritrophic interactions. Increasing interest in the areas of nutritional and ecological immunology over the last decade have revealed that plant primary and secondary metabolites can influence the outcomes of insect-pathogen interactions by altering insect immune functioning and physical barriers to pathogen entry. Some insects use plant secondary chemicals and nutrients to prevent infections (prophylactic medication) and medicate to limit the severity of infections (therapeutic medication). Recent findings suggest that there may be selectable plant traits that enhance entomopathogen efficacy, suggesting that entomopathogens could potentially impose selection pressure on plant traits that improve both path- ogen and plant fitness. Moreover, plants in nature are inhabited by diverse communities of microbes, in addition to entomopathogens, some of which can trigger immune re- sponses in insect herbivores. Plants are also shared by numer- ous other herbivorous arthropods with different modes of feeding that can trigger different defensive responses in plants. Some insect symbionts and gut microbes can degrade ingested defensive phytochemicals and be orally secreted onto wounded plant tissue during herbivory to alter plant defenses. Since non-entomopathogenic microbes and other arthropods are likely to influence the outcomes of plant-

insect-entomopathogen interactions, I discuss a need to con- sider these multitrophic interactions within the greater web of species interactions.

Introduction

Plants and insect herbivores harbor a variety of beneficial and pathogenic microbes. Within this multitrophic context, nu- merous complex interactions have been identified, including the alteration of plant defenses by plant and insect associated mutualistic symbionts and phytopathogens that can influence the performance of insect herbivores (Biere and Bennett ; Biere and Tack ; Shikano et al. ). Much of the research on insect pathogens (entomopathogens) has focused on their development as biological control agents (Lacey et al. ). In the last decade, the use of microbial pesticides in the global market has grown considerably. This is mostly attributable to the European Union, where  a  decline  in the use of conventional broad-spectrum chemical insec- ticides has coincided with an increase in the  organic  sector and a more favorable regulatory environment for companies to commercialize microbial pesticides (Lacey  et al. ). Thus, it has become increasingly important    to determine the extent to which the effectiveness of

 		microbial pesticides will vary on different crop species,

cultivars and varieties. Stimulated by the seminal review paper by Cory and Hoover (), there has concurrent-   ly been a growing number of studies that have focused     on plant-insect-entomopathogen interactions from eco- logical and evolutionary perspectives.



Plants are the main drivers of the interactions with their insect herbivores and the insect's pathogens. At the time of the Cory and Hoover () review, research on these tritrophic interactions were mainly focused on the direct ef- fects of toxic phytochemicals on entomopathogen persistence and infectivity (Fig. a) and on the growth rate of insect her- bivores, which can influence their developmental (or age- related) resistance to entomopathogens (Fig. b). Since their review, there has been substantial strengthening in the areas of nutritional and ecological immunology. A surge in these re- search areas have revealed that host plants and dietary nutri- ents can influence insect immune functioning (Fig. b) (Lampert ; Ponton et al. ). Interestingly, some insects have demonstrated the ability to acquire certain phytochemicals and nutrients as a prophylactic or ther- apeutic response to entomopathogen risk or infection (Abbott ; De Roode et al. ). Additionally, an impor- tant factor that received little attention in plant-insect- entomopathogen interactions a decade ago was that the sur- face of plants and the guts of insects are teeming with diverse communities of non-entomopathogenic microbes (Engel and Moran ; Vorholt ; Whipps et al. ). Recent stud- ies indicate that some of these microbes may modulate the tritrophic interactions by altering plant and insect immune responses (Biere and Bennett ; Biere and Tack ; Shikano et al. ), suggesting that our understanding of plant-insect-entomopathogen interactions determined under sterile laboratory conditions may not necessarily extrapolate

to the field. Lastly, a key proposal made by Cory and Hoover () was that plants may manipulate entomopathogens for their own benefit. However, empirical evidence for this is still lacking. Instead, I suggest that entomopathogens may impose selection pressure on plant traits that benefit both plant and entomopathogen fitness (Fig. d). Here, I review what has been learned in the last decade, with most of the focus on plant and insect interactions with three pathogen groups: bacteria, fungi and viruses. There are numerous mechanisms by which plants influence insect-entomopathogen interactions, but the generalities and context dependence of these mechanisms are still largely unknown.
Food-mediated variations in pathogen virulence and host susceptibility can strongly affect the timing, duration and se- verity of epidemics in wildlife populations (Elderd et al. ; Hall et al. ). Thus, determining how food-quality drives this variation is necessary, not only for improving the efficacy of microbial pesticides and understanding disease-mediated insect population dynamics, but also for predicting and con- trolling wildlife diseases, which could have implications for ecosystem health and biodiversity.


Nutrition-Mediated Effects on Insect Resistance against Entomopathogens

Nutritional studies have revealed the importance of dietary protein in the resistance of insects to entomopathogens. However, whether increased dietary protein improves or reduces host resistance varies among insect-entomopathogen systems, depending on how protein affects insect immune functioning and entomopathogen growth. Increased consump- tion of dietary protein relative to carbohydrate, either before or after pathogen challenge, enhanced the survival of larval lep- idopterans against baculoviruses (Lee et al. ; Povey et al. ; Shikano and Cory ), a food-borne bacterium (Bacillus thuringiensis) (Shikano and Cory ), and a cuti- cle-entering opportunistic bacterium (B. subtillus) (Povey et al. ), but reduced the survival of Australian plague locusts (Chortoicetes terminifera) infected by a fungal entomopathogen (Metarhizium acridum)  (Graham et al. ). The heightened resistance of lepidopterans to viral and bacterial infections were associated with higher immune activity on protein-rich diets (e.g. enhanced he- molymph antibacterial and phenoloxidase activities, he- mocyte numbers and encapsulation response (Lee et al. ; Povey et al. , )) (see also a review on macronutrient effects on insect immune functioning (Ponton et al. )). In locusts, increased consumption   of carbohydrate relative  to  protein  increased  resistance  to fungal infection, even though this reduced their im- mune functioning, because the fungus thrives on high nitrogen resources (Graham et al. ).



The effectiveness of insect immune responses against entomopathogens can also depend on the intake of dietary micronutrients. Ascorbic acid deficiency decreased the num- ber of circulating hemocytes in codling moth, Cydia pomonella, larvae and increased their susceptibility to a fun- gus (Beauveria bassiana) and bacterium (B. thuringiensis) (Pristavko and Dovzhenok ). Deficiency in ascorbic acid also increased the susceptibility of tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens, to baculovirus infection (AcMNPV) (Popham and Shelby ). Dietary trace metals may also play an important role in insect immune functioning and re- sistance to entomopathogens. The concentrations of multiple trace metals in the hemolymph of fourth instar tobacco bud- worms were altered in response to baculovirus (HzSNPV) infection (Popham et al. ). Iron in the hemolymph of greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella, larvae has been shown to be essential in clearing dead bacteria (Xenorhabdas nematophila and Bacillus subtilis) (Dunphy et al. ). Zinc added to Grace's medium increased the length of tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, plasmatocytes and enhanced plasmatocyte network formation (Willott and Tran ). Lastly, dietary selenium supplementation increased the re- sistance of the cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni, to a baculovirus (AcMNPV), though the mechanism is unknown (Popham et al. ).
There can be considerable variation in macro and micronu- trient content among plants. These can include variation between plant species, genotypes within a species, parts within a plant, ontogenetic stages, seasons and fertilization treatments (Genc et al. ; Grusak and DellaPenna ; Mattson ). Thus, nutritional studies suggest that variation in nutrients among plants play an important role in insect disease resistance. However, these studies isolate the effects of nutrients and ignore the complexity of interactions among plant nutrients and defen- sive allelochemicals that may influence insect-entomopathogen interactions. For example, plant allelochemicals can strongly alter insect nutrient intake and utilization (Simpson and Raubenheimer ), suggesting that the strength of insect immune functioning cannot be predicted from plant nutritional content in the presence of plant allelochemicals. Thus, plant- mediated effects on insect susceptibility to entomopathogens are far less clear-cut than nutritional effects.


Plant-Mediated Effects on Insect Resistance against Food-Borne Entomopathogens

Phytochemicals can impose conflicting effects on insect growth and immunity, while simultaneously interacting with nutritional factors. The majority of studies on plant-mediated changes in insect immune functioning (reviewed in Lampert ()) do not test if these immunological changes have any meaningful effects on entomopathogens. Thus, I focus on the

few studies that have established a link among all three fac- tors. A component of the cellular immune response (hemocyte numbers) and resistance to a baculovirus (TnSNPV) in cab- bage loopers were significantly higher if the insects were fed broccoli foliage rather than cucumber foliage, though a com- ponent of the humoral immune response (phenoloxidase ac- tivity) was lower on broccoli (Shikano et al. ). Cabbage looper growth rate and hemolymph protein concentration (as a proxy for insect condition/health) were also higher in broccoli-fed insects, suggesting that a higher quality food plant for development was better for resistance to TnSNPV (Shikano et al. ). In a follow-up study, cabbage loopers grew faster and had higher humoral immune activity (i.e. higher hemolymph antibacterial and phenoloxidase activities) on cucumber foliage than cabbage foliage, but cucumber-fed larvae were more susceptible to B. thuringiensis and were equally resistant to TnSNPV as cabbage-fed larvae (Shikano et al. ). Hemolymph protein concentration and the num- bers of hemocytes did not significantly differ between larvae fed the two food plant treatments (Shikano et al. ). These two studies suggest that plant-mediated effects on cabbage looper hemocyte numbers and hemolymph protein concentra- tion could be predictive of resistance to TnSNPV. However, they did not confirm whether higher hemocyte numbers results in more encapsulation of virus infection foci or whether higher hemolymph protein means more antiviral proteins are avail- able. Curiously, resistance to B. thuringiensis was not associ- ated with plant-mediated effects on insect growth, condition or immune functioning (Shikano et al. ).
A key component of resistance influenced by plant quality that has received little attention is the physical barriers of the insect. For instance, the peritrophic matrix (protective barrier lining the midgut) is known to provide some resistance against entomopathogens from reaching the midgut epithelium (Granados et al. ; Plymale et al. ; Vijendravarma et al. ) and short-term feeding (8 h) on different food plant species can alter the thickness and structure (number of layers) of the peritrophic matrix (Plymale et al. ). Variation in plant (or food) quality can also influence the iden- tity and amount of salivary and digestive enzymes (Afshar et al. , ; Brioschi et al. ; Broadway and Duffey ; Gruner and Taylor ; Peiffer and Felton ), which may enhance or hinder pathogen entry depend- ing on the enzymes and entomopathogens involved. For ex- ample, the salivary enzyme glucose oxidase of the corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea, was antibacterial against Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Musser et al. ). Multiple digestive enzymes in the silkworm, Bombyx mori, have been shown to have antiviral activity against its baculovirus (BmNPV) (e.g. Nakazawa et al. ; Ponnuvel et al. , ), but digestive enzymes are also involved in releasing infectious virus particles (occlusion derived viruses) from polyhedral occlusion bodies (Pritchett et al. ).



Moreover, short-term feeding on low nutrient food can induce compensatory feeding whereby insects ingest more food and allocate more biomass to the gut to improve digestive efficien- cy (Couture et al. ; Hawlena et al. ; Raubenheimer and Bassil ; Yang and Joern ). Gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, larvae that fed for 4 days on a low nutrient diet still maintained the same growth rate as larvae on high nutrient diet by consuming almost fourfold more diet. These larvae also exhibited a fourfold increase in gut biomass rela- tive to total body weight (Couture et al. ). The addition of plant secondary metabolites (salicinoids) reduced consump- tion rate and gut biomass allocation (Couture et al. ). While this study did not measure insect susceptibility to entomopathogens, nutrition and phytochemical-mediated changes in consumption rate will undoubtedly influence the ingested pathogen dose. The resulting plasticity in gut bio- mass might also influence the susceptibility of insects to entomopathogens by changing the surface area of the gut for entomopathogens to establish primary infections.
Deterioration in food quality (e.g. herbivore-induced plant defenses, reduced nutrient quality and starvation) is often associated with high herbivore population density, which  is predictive of a higher likelihood of  contacting  dis- eased individuals (Fig. ). This is particularly the case for density dependent, horizontally transmitted entomopathogens such as baculoviruses. For insects with short-generation times or those that are non-migratory, such as some forest Lepidoptera, poor food quality experienced by one generation may predict an even greater risk of disease for their offspring. Correspondingly, the immune functioning and resistance of some insects to entomopathogens can vary with the food qual- ity experienced by their parents. Western tent caterpillars,

Malacosoma californicum pluviale, that consumed herbivore-induced red alder (Alnus rubra) leaves, compared to non-induced leaves, produced offspring with significantly elevated encapsulation responses and marginally higher phenoloxidase activities, though hemocyte numbers and he- molymph protein concentration did not differ (Olson ). These offspring were also more likely to survive baculovirus challenge, and those that succumbed to infection took longer to die than offspring from parents reared on non-induced alder leaves (Olson ). The mechanism behind this plant- mediated trangenerational induction of offspring immunity is unknown. Antibacterial activities and protein and lipid con- centration in the eggs did not differ between the parental food treatments, though the eggs produced by parents reared on induced leaves were smaller (Olson et al. ). Nutritional studies have found that larval cabbage loopers and Indian meal moths, Plodia interpunctella, under nutritional stress can also produce offspring with elevated immune functioning (hemolymph antibacterial and phenoloxidase activities) and resistance against baculoviruses and B. thuringiensis (Boots and Roberts ; Shikano et al. ). In contrast to the smaller eggs produced by induced foliage-fed Western tent caterpillars, the heightened immunity in the offspring of nu- tritionally stressed cabbage loopers was associated with larger eggs (Shikano et al. ). Importantly, the two nutritional studies reduced caloric value by diluting nutrients (Boots and Roberts ; Shikano et al. ). However, parental diet quality did not influence offspring immunity in cabbage loopers when nutrition was manipulated by altering protein to carbohydrate ratios to maintain caloric value (Shikano  et al. ). This suggests that the impact of changes in plant quality on cross-generational insect disease dynamics may de- pend on numerous factors, including the nutritional composi- tion and content of the plants and the influence of plant de- fenses on the ability of insects to ingest and extract nutrients.
Evolutionarily, food quality can impose conflicting selec- tion pressures on the dual functions of the insect's gut to serve as a barrier against entomopathogens and extract nutrients from food (Vijendravarma et al. ). Adaptation of Drosophila melanogaster populations during 160 generations of experimental selection to chronic larval malnutrition on a nutritionally dilute artificial diet increased their susceptibility to infection by the opportunistic food-borne bacterial patho- gen Pseudomonas entomophilya (Vijendravarma et al. ). The increased susceptibility resulted from a higher predispo- sition of the peritrophic matrix to disintegrate upon infection and not from a weakened immune response or higher bacterial loads (Vijendravarma et al. ). Since different food plant species altered the thickness and structure of the peritrophic matrix of tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens (Plymale et al. ), it is likely that the nutrition-mediated trade-off between the two functions of the fruit fly's gut will be influ- enced by phytochemicals in its natural foods.



Plant-Mediated Effects on Insect Resistance against Cuticle-Entering Entomopathogens

Plant-mediated effects on cuticle-entering pathogens are also complex. When challenged by a fungal entomopathogen (Metarhizium anisopliae), larvae of the rusty tussock moth, Orgyia antiqua, which is a polyphagous insect that feeds on a wide range of deciduous trees and shrubs, had improved survival when reared on foliage from a willow species (Salix myrsinifolia) that contained higher concentrations of phenolic glycosides compared to a willow with lower concentrations (S. viminalis) (Sandre et al. ). In the absence of the entomopathogen, larvae survived better on the willow species that contained less phenolic glycosides. The study controlled for direct plant effects on conidia germination by exposing insects from both willow species to fungal conidia on foliage from the same plant species (birch). The plant-mediated dif- ferences in resistance was not associated with encapsulation rate (a component of immune functioning) or body condition (Sandre et al. ), suggesting that phenolic glycosides or their metabolites may have accumulated in the hemocoel and directly harmed the fungus; though dietary phenolic glyco- sides have been show to increase immune functioning in an- other system (Del Campo et al. ).
The cuticle is a key component of resistance against many entomopathogens as it provides both physical and biochemi- cal protection (Moret and Moreau ). For example, fungal germ tubes can be melanized as they pass through the cuticle before they enter the hemocoel (Golkar et al. ). Yet sur- prisingly, no studies have considered plant-mediated changes to the cuticle's defensive properties. A nutritional study dem- onstrated that the source of dietary protein (plant or animal based) can influence melanization of the insect cuticle (i.e. darkness of the cuticle) (Lee et al. ). Since the quality of plant protein is highly variable between plant species and between tissues within a plant (Felton ), plant-mediated effects on the cuticle deserve more attention.


Consumption of Phytochemicals and Nutrients to Increase Resistance against Entomopathogens

Some insects can take advantage of toxic phytochemicals by sequestering them to protect against predation and parasitism (Nishida ). Few systems have examined whether phyto- chemicals can protect herbivorous insects against entomopathogens. Monarch butterflies and their cardenolide- containing milkweed plants are probably the most thoroughly studied in this regard. Increasing cardenolide content of milk- weed species consumed by monarch larvae infected by a pro- tozoan parasite (Ophryocystis elektroscirrha) elevated their resistance and tolerance (De Roode et al. ; Gowler et al. ; Sternberg et al. ). Non-sequestering insects can

accumulate some phytochemicals in their tissues, depending on their ability, or lack thereof, to detoxify these compounds. For example, the steroidal glycoalkaloid a-tomatine in the diet of tomato fruitworm, Helicoverpa zea, infected by a fungal entomopathogen (Nomuraea rileyi) lowered larval mortality by reducing conidia production in vivo (Gallardo et al. ). Importantly, while phytochemicals can afford some level of protection to insects against entomopathogens, it is possible that entomopathogens may adapt to the plants fed on by their hosts. De Roode et al. () showed that a protozoan para- site (O. elektroscirrha) compensated for the phytochemical- mediated reduction in effective infectious dose against mon- arch larvae by evolving higher virulence. Adaptation of entomopathogens to their host's food plants may be likely in stable plant-insect-entomopathogen systems, such as insect populations in geographically isolated areas dominated by a single plant species. For example, among three geographically distinct island populations of western tent caterpillars, Malacosoma californicum pluviale, on different dominant host plants, baculovirus isolates from two of the permanent host populations had the fastest speed of kill on the plant from
which they were isolated (Cory and Myers ).
In response to high pathogen risk, insects can engage in disease preventing behavior termed prophylactic medication (Abbott ; De Roode et al. ). Uninfected wood ants, Formica paralugubris, collected antimicrobial, antifungal terpene-containing resin from conifer trees and incorporated them into their nests to prevent disease in the colony (Chapuisat et al. ). These ants also applied significant amounts of endogenous formic and succinic acid on the resin, which greatly increased its antifungal activity (Brutsch et al. ). Diseased insects have also been demonstrated to medi- cate themselves in response to entomopathogen infection, termed therapeutic- or self-medication (Abbott ; De Roode et al. ). Honey bee colonies infected by a fungal entomopathogen (Ascophaera apis) decreased infection inten- sities in the colonies by increasing their foraging for resin, a form of group- or colony-medication (Simone-Finstrom and Spivak ). Self-medicating behavior by individual bees to cure themselves using single substances such as nicotine has also been suggested, but the strength and effectiveness of this behavior are weak (Baracchi et al. ). It is possible that insects rely on combinations of phytochemicals or Bdefensive cocktails^ to therapeutically limit infections. For example, com- binations of two floral phytochemicals, eugenol and thymol, had synergistic effects against the bumblebee gut trypanosome Crithidia bombi (Palmer-Young et al. ). The clearest dem- onstration of self-medication in insects, through intentional in- gestion of phytochemicals, occurred in response to parasitiza- tion by tachinid flies (endoparasites). Parasitized woolly bear caterpillars, Grammia incorrupta, increased their ingestion of pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which increased their chances of surviv- al (Singer et al. ). Even though monarch butterfly larvae



that are parasitized by the protozoan parasite O. elektroscirrha are more resistant on higher cardenolide containing plants, they do not engage in self-medication by consuming more cardenolides (Lefevre et al. ). Instead, infected monarchs engaged in transgenerational- or maternal-medication by pref- erentially laying their eggs on plants containing higher concen- trations of cardenolides as there is a risk of vertically transmit- ting the parasite to their offspring (Lefevre et al. ).
The infection-induced change in feeding behavior is not exclusive to phytochemicals. Nutritional studies have demon- strated that insects can alter their nutrient intake in response to entomopathogen infection. Larval lepidopterans increased their proportional intake of protein relative to carbohydrate in response to infection by bacterial (B. subtillus) and viral (baculoviruses) entomopathogens, either as a means to self- medicate or compensate for protein resources used in the im- mune response (Lee et al. ; Povey et al. , ; Shikano and Cory ). Insects might also change their nu- trient intake to limit resources for the entomopathogen. As mentioned previously, the fungal entomopathogen Metarhizium acridum flourishes on high nitrogen resources. In response to infection by M. acridum, locusts improved their chances of survival by increasing their intake of carbohydrate and decreasing their intake of protein (Graham et al. ).
The extent to which prophylactic and therapeutic medicating behavior occurs in nature and its effects on entomopathogen transmission dynamics are still largely unknown. For instance, we know little about the specificity of therapeutic compounds to different pathogens. Tomatine (1000 ppm) added to Noble agar completely inhibited the germination of Paecilomyces fumosoroseus but only inhibited the germination of
B. bassiana by 45% relative to germination in the absence of tomatine (Poprawski et al. ). Consequently, the insect's self- medicating behaviors are likely to be system and/or condition specific. Cabbage loopers only increased their protein intake in response to challenge by a generalist baculovirus (AcMNPV) at 24 degC but not at 32 degC, and not in response to its specialist baculovirus (TnSNPV) (Shikano and Cory ). In fact the increased protein intake by AcMNPV-challenged insects at 24 degC, though statistically significant, would only slightly in- crease the probability of survival and is unlikely to have any meaningful effects on transmission dynamics. Field studies are needed to examine whether food choice can actually influence disease dynamics in natural populations. Lastly, it is also possible that infection-induced behavior that has been interpreted as med- icating behavior could somehow be benefiting pathogen fitness even if the behavior reduces host mortality (Karban and English- Loeb ). Some entomopathogens can manipulate the move- ment and feeding behavior of their hosts, which enhance entomopathogen distribution and persistence on plants (e.g. Andersen et al. ; Hoover et al. ; Mehlhorn ; Raymond et al. ; van Houte et al. ). However, patho- gen fitness is rarely measured in studies of insect medication.

Potential for Entomopathogens to Influence the Evolution of Plant Defenses

Baculovirus occlusion bodies (transmission stages) can be inactivated by leaf exudates, as they wait to be ingested by susceptible hosts (Cory and Hoover ; Stevenson et al. ), and by herbivore-induced phytochemicals, which are released during the maceration of plant tissues by chewing insects (Cory and Hoover ). It seems counterintuitive for plants to harm the natural enemies of herbivores. Instead we might expect that entomopathogens should impose selection pressures on plant traits to minimize their harm. Wan et al. () found that among 14 crop plant species, the lethality of a baculovirus against beet armyworms was only significantly reduced by a few plant species. Thus, plant-mediated inhibition of baculovirus infectivity may be an exception and not the rule. We recently demonstrated that the levels of baculovirus- induced mortality in fall armyworms can differ with the intra- specific genetic variation in plants ingested with the virus (Shikano et al. ). Induction of anti-herbivore defenses through exogenous application of the phytohormone jasmonic acid inhibited baculovirus (SfMNPV) lethality to varying de- grees among the eight soybean genotypes tested (Shikano et al. ). Induced plant traits that inhibited digestion in the fall armyworm were associated with reduced baculovirus lethality, but not traits that deterred feeding (Shikano et al. ). Induction of higher levels of peroxidase activity, which is an enzyme involved in plant defense against herbi- vores, was associated with reduced baculovirus lethality on cotton and tomato plants (AcMNPVand HzSNPV, respective- ly) (Hoover et al. ), although this was not the mechanism on soybean plants (Shikano et al. ). Interestingly, while the induction of another important enzyme in plant defense, polyphenol oxidase, did not inhibit baculovirus lethality (Hoover et al. ), incubation of B. thuringiensis with poly- phenol oxidase significantly increased the lethality of
B. thuringiensis (Ludlum et al. ). B. thuringiensis lethal- ity increased even more if the bacteria was incubated with a combination of polyphenol oxidase and chlorogenic acid, both of which are key defensive phytochemicals in tomato plants (Ludlum et al. ). Since genotypes within a plant species can vary in their levels and compositions of constitu- tive and induced defensive compounds, these findings suggest that there may be selectable plant defensive traits that can enhance entomopathogen efficacy. Such traits could be targeted in plant breeding programs to improve the compati- bility of plant defenses with entomopathogens to maximize plant protection.
Intraspecific genetic variation is fundamental for species to respond rapidly to environmental conditions. Insect herbi- vores can exert selective pressures on plant defense traits and different herbivore species can favor specific defense traits (Zust et al. ). Moreover, the use of chemical



insecticides to suppress insect herbivores can change the fa- vored plant traits to select for plant genotypes that grow more competitively against other genotypes and species (Agrawal et al. ). In addition to the differential effects of soybean genotypes on baculovirus lethality, we have shown that the ingestion of baculovirus occlusion bodies with different soy- bean genotypes can influence the yield of occlusion bodies produced in the host (Shikano et al. ). For obligate- killing pathogens like baculoviruses, the number of hosts killed and the number of occlusion bodies released from each killed host into the environment to infect new hosts are im- portant factors for transmission dynamics. Thus, it is conceiv- able that there may be selection for plant traits that minimizes their detrimental effects on entomopathogen efficacy, particu- larly in natural systems with high insect pressure and ample entomopathogen reservoirs or in agricultural systems that con- sistently use microbial insecticides. Because of these intraspe- cific plant effects and the patchily distributed nature of entomopathogens, the plant traits favored by entomopathogen protection may differ from those selected by the broad suppression of insects by chemical insecticides. On the other hand, since the most important roles of plant de- fense chemicals is probably for protection against herbivores and plant pathogens, it may be too speculative to think that plant genotype-mediated variation in entomopathogen efficacy could be beneficial enough for plants to warrant selective changes in their defense traits. Adaptation of entomopathogens to the phytochemicals in their host's food plants, as discussed earlier, may be more likely.
Another possibility for entomopathogen-driven evolution of plant traits is through the endophytic colonization of plants by entomopathogenic fungi. Endophytic colonization by entomopathogenic fungi can protect plants from insects (Ownley et al. ). For example, fungal isolates from five genera (Beauveria, Hypocrea, Gibberella, Fusarium and Trichoderma) colonized the roots, stems and leaves of fava beans (Vicia faba) and common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) and killed 100% of pea leafminers (Liriomyza huidobrensis) on the plants. Interestingly, two Beauveria isolates (G1 LU3 and S4SU1) colonized roots, stems, and leaves of P. vulgaris but only the root and stem of V. faba, indicating that the ability of endophytic entomopathogenic fungi to colonize can vary by plant species and parts within a plant (Akutse et al. ). Moreover, opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) plants were shown to vertically transmit B. bassiana via seeds (Quesada- Moraga et al. ). It is still not known if intraspecific genet- ic variation in plants can influence the ability of endophytic entomopathogenic fungi to colonize and vertically transmit. If it does, protection from these fungi under high insect pressure may select for plant genotypes that favor endophytic coloni- zation. It would also be interesting to see if plants can use these fungi as bodyguards by modifying their physiology dur- ing herbivory to enhance or invite endophytic colonization.

Complex Species Interactions: Other Herbivores, Microbes and Sublethal Entomopathogen Doses

Insects share their food plants with many other herbivores, including those that feed on the same or different parts of plants and may have different modes of feeding that differen- tially influence plant defenses (Fig. a). For example, aphids indirectly increased the virulence and transmission potential of a monarch butterfly parasite through aphid-induced chang- es in the chemical composition of the shared milkweed plant (De Roode et al. ).
Insects will also encounter a wide array of microbes that inhabit the surface of their food plants (Fig. b-d), including sublethal doses of their pathogens. Surviving a previous entomopathogen-challenge has been associated with in- creased resistance to the same entomopathogen upon subse- quent exposure (termed immune priming) (e.g. Pham et al. ; Tidbury et al. ) and this immunity can be trans- ferred maternally to protect offspring (Sadd and Schmid- Hempel ; Shikano et al. ; Tidbury et al. ). The mechanism of maternal or transgenerational immune priming against bacterial pathogens can occur through the binding of the egg-yolk protein vitellogenin to pathogen- associated molecular patterns, which then transports the bac- terial cell-wall pieces into the developing oocytes (Salmela et al. ). The transferred bacterial fragments in the eggs appears to act as the immune elicitor for the offspring (Freitak et al. ; Salmela et al. ).
Ingestion of non-entomopathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus) have also been shown to induce the activity of antibacterial enzymes and the expression of immune-related proteins in the hemolymph of cabbage loopers (Freitak et al. ) and greater wax moth larvae (Freitak et al. ). Non-entomopathogenic bacteria are al- ways present on plants in the field (Fig. b). This suggests that insect immune systems are continuously maintained at elevat- ed levels, which would be energetically costly for the insect. Cabbage loopers that ingested these non-entomopathogenic bacteria had reduced pupal weight and prolonged develop- ment (Freitak et al. ). An alternative is that the immune priming may have resulted from the novelty of the bacteria to the insect, which included an enteric anaerobic bacterium (E. coli) and an obligate saprotrophic aerobe (M. luteus) that colonizes the skin and mucous membranes of warm-blooded animals. In greater wax moth larvae, the immune responses to
E. coli and M. luteus were significantly weaker than the im- mune responses against entomopathogenic bacteria (Serratia entomophila and Pseudomonas entomophila) (Freitak et al. ). Thus, while consumption of non-entomopathogenic bacteria may have induced a statistically significant immune response, the strength of this immune priming may have little influence on resisting a subsequent pathogen challenge. In a more  ecologically relevant system,  ingestion of   non-

can alter the immune functioning of insect herbivores. Some of these microbes can colonize the insect gut and competitively exclude entomopathogens. Some insects can orally secrete gut microbes onto wounded plant tissue during feeding to suppress plant defenses, which is likely to alter plant-insect-entomopathogen interactions. c Plant pathogens and d plant beneficial microbes can influence insect resistance to entomopathogens by changing plant defenses and nutritional quality.

entomopathogenic phyllosphere bacteria (Pseudomonas fluorescens and P. syringae) that are commonly associated with the cabbage looper's food plants had no significant im- pact on immune functioning (hemolymph antibacterial and PO activities and hemocyte numbers) or resistance to the entomopathogens B. thuringiensis and a baculovirus, though the presence of the bacteria reduced the cabbage looper's growth rate and condition (Shikano et al. ).
Microbes on the phyllosphere can colonize and persist in insect midguts (Mason and Raffa ; Priya et al. ) and plant species and genotype can influence the community com- position of gut microbiota (Broderick et al. ; Mason et al. ; Tang et al. ). Lab-reared beet armyworms, Spodoptera exigua, challenged by its baculovirus (SeMNPV) suffered significantly higher mortality and pro- duced more viral occlusion bodies when larvae were reared on artificial diet without antibiotics to preserve gut microbiota (Enterococcus and Enterobacter spp.) than on diet containing antibiotics (Jakubowska et al. ). In contrast, the gut bac- terium Streptococcus faecalis of lab-reared greater wax moth larvae has been shown to competitively suppress infection by multiple ingested entomopathogens (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and B. thuringiensis) (Jarosz ). Importantly, the gut microbiota of lab insects reared on artificial diet are typically dominated by only a few culturable

species (e.g. Broderick et al. ; Jakubowska et al. ; Johnston and Crickmore ). By comparison, the gut mi- crobial communities of wild insects feeding on plants are dra- matically more diverse, and the composition of these commu- nities can vary widely by plant species (Broderick et al. ; Chung et al. ; Mason and Raffa ). How the gut microbiota of wild insects influences entomopathogen effica- cy remains to be tested. Moreover, insect gut microbes can be involved in the degradation of defensive phytochemicals (Mason et al. ; Pilon et al. ; Welte et al. ) and can be orally secreted onto wounded plant tissue during her- bivory to alter plant defenses (Acevedo et al. ; Barr et al. ; Casteel et al. ; Chung et al. ). Thus, it is highly likely that insect gut microbes may also influence insect sus- ceptibility and entomopathogen virulence by modulating plant physiology and chemistry.
Phytopathogens and plant-associated beneficial endo- phytes and soil microbes also influence plant nutritional qual- ity and defense (Fig. c, d) (Choudhary and Varma ; Pieterse et al. ; Stout et al. ), which can influence insect-entomopathogen interactions. For instance, infection of Chinese cabbage leaves by a phytopathogenic fungus (Alternaria brassicae) slowed the growth rate of mustard leaf beetle, Phaedon cochleariae, larvae by reducing leaf quality (Rostas and Hilker ). Consequently, this increased larval



mortality to an entomopathogenic fungus (Metarhizium anisopliae) by increasing the period of vulnerability (Rostas and Hilker ). Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi associated with milkweed plants influenced the interaction between mon- arch butterflies and their protozoan parasites (Tao et al. ). Parasite virulence, host resistance and host tolerance were differentially affected depending on the arbuscular mycorrhi- zal fungi's effects on the primary (phosphorus) and secondary (cardenolides) chemistry of different milkweed species (Tao et al. ).
It is increasingly clear that non-entomopathogenic mi- crobes play important roles in plant-insect-entomopathogen interactions. Variation in the compositions of insect and plant- associated microbes among host species and genotypes sug- gest that the microbes' effects on entomopathogens are likely to be system specific. Tools to identify and quantify microbes and their functions are becoming increasingly available. These tools should facilitate more studies to determine the influences of individual and communities of microbes on complex multitrophic interactions.


Future Challenges

It is clear that plant-insect-entomopathogen interactions are intertwined within a complex web of species interactions. An important question going forward is whether our understand- ing of these multitrophic interactions based on controlled lab- oratory experiments will translate to field conditions. Few studies have examined plant-insect-entomopathogen interac- tions in the field. Raymond and Hails () demonstrated that both host plant species and phenology in the field can influence the levels of infection and the numbers of infectious stages produced by infected larvae of the winter moth, Operophtera brumata, fed foliage of oak and Sitka spruce trees treated with a baculovirus (O. brumata NPV). Elderd et al. () examined the effects of induced anti-herbivore defenses (hydrolizable tannins) in red oaks (Quercus rubra) on the susceptibility of gypsy moth larvae to a baculovirus in the field. They found that on induced foliage, average infec- tion rates were lower at lower virus density but higher at higher virus density, compared to non-induced foliage. AIC analysis demonstrated that induction produced a linear rela- tionship between virus transmission and virus density. This implied that induction strongly reduced variability in infection risk because high levels of variability in infection risk between individuals produces nonlinear virus transmission. Their mod- el suggests that the inducibility of hydrolysable tannin de- fenses in oaks may play an important role in the alternating outbreaks of gypsy moth in forests with a high frequency of oaks, compared to the uniform outbreaks in forests with a low frequency of oaks. While these studies extend beyond the laboratory, they restricted groups of larvae to individual

branches or plants. This limits insect movement, thereby restricting their exposure to variations in plant quality and consequently may have influenced infection rates.
A major difference between laboratory and field conditions is the dose of entomopathogens insects are likely to encounter. In the laboratory, most studies use either a range of doses in a bioassay or a single dose that produces moderate levels of infection, such as an LD50. One of the biggest gaps in under- standing the dynamics of entomopathogens in the field is that almost nothing is known about the distribution and amount of transmission stages that are on wild plants, even under epizo- otic conditions. Plants may influence the numbers of infec- tious transmission stages produced in infected hosts. For ex- ample, the plant species fed on by infected hosts can differen- tially select baculovirus genotypes, which vary in their infec- tivity, speed of kill and yield (Hodgson et al. , ). Even plant genotypes and induced defenses in the foliage consumed by infected hosts can influence the numbers of baculovirus transmission stages produced (Shikano et al. ). Entomopathogen-killed cadavers contain highly con- centrated numbers of infectious transmission stages, meaning that insects in the field may be most likely to ingest/contact doses at the extremes, sublethal doses and extremely high doses, rather than moderately lethal doses. Extremely high doses in the field may overwhelm any plant and nutrition- mediated effects on insect-entomopathogen interactions. Few studies have examined how the natural distributions and amounts of entomopathogen transmission stages on plants influence transmission dynamics, and the findings are unclear. Transmission of the recombinant and wild-type baculovirus AcMNPV in cabbage loopers in the field depended more on the numbers of virus-killed cadavers (i.e. inoculum patches) on the plants than the size of the cadavers (i.e. size of inocu- lum) (Hails et al. ). In contrast, larger patches of baculovirus (Panolis flammea NPV) inoculum (i.e. size of cadaver) induced higher mortality in the following generation of cabbage moth (Mamestra brassicae) larvae on the same plants, even when fewer patches were present (Hesketh and Hails ). The contradictory results could have arisen from any number of differences between the two studies including the viruses and hosts used, though both studies used cabbage plants. Knowing more about the occurrence and distribution of entomopathogens is crucial to any further understanding of tritrophic interactions.
While plants can clearly mediate the interactions between insects and their pathogens, little is still known about if or how these interactions extend to the occurrence and intensity of epizootics. Key future challenges include improving our knowledge of what entomopathogens insects encounter in the field, at what doses and how often insects encounter these doses (e.g. uniformly distributed low doses or patchy high doses). Without this knowledge, extrapolation of our current understanding of multitrophic interactions to natural processes



should be made with caution. Only through the use of ecolog- ically relevant doses and distributions of entomopathogens could we comprehend the importance of plant-mediated ef- fects on insect-entomopathogen interactions in the field, not to mention the myriad of ways that complex natural species interactions may influence these multitrophic interactions.
