Abstract
Eukaryotic-like proteins (ELPs) are classes of proteins that are found in prokaryotes, but have a likely evolutionary origin in eukaryotes. ELPs have been postulated to mediate host-microbiome interactions. Recent work has discovered that prokaryotic symbionts of sponges contain abundant and diverse genes for ELPs, which could mod- ulate interactions with their filter-feeding and phagocytic host. However, the extent to which these ELP genes are actually used and expressed by the symbionts is poorly understood. Here, we use metatranscriptomics to investigate ELP expression in the microbiomes of three different sponges (Cymbastella concentrica, Scopalina sp. and Tedania anhelens). We developed a workflow with optimized rRNA removal and in sil- ico subtraction of host sequences to obtain a reliable symbiont  metatranscriptome.  This showed that between 1.3% and 2.3% of all symbiont transcripts contain genes for ELPs. Two classes of ELPs (cadherin and tetratricopeptide repeats) were abundantly expressed in the C. concentrica and Scopalina sp. microbiomes, while ankyrin repeat ELPs were predominant in the T. anhelens metatranscriptome. Comparison with tran- scripts that do not encode ELPs indicated a constitutive expression of ELPs across a range of bacterial and archaeal symbionts. Expressed ELPs also contained domains involved in protein secretion and/or were co-expressed with proteins involved in extra- cellular transport. This suggests these ELPs are likely exported, which could allow for direct interaction with the sponge. Our study shows that ELP genes in sponge sym- bionts represent actively expressed functions that could mediate molecular interaction between symbiosis partners.

Introduction
Sponges (phylum Porifera) are early-divergent meta- zoans that represent a major part of the marine benthic fauna across the world's oceans (Taylor et al. 2007; Bell 2008). Sponges are known to contain stable and diverse microbial communities from all three domains of life. In some cases, these microbial associates comprise as  much as 40% of the sponge volume and can contribute significantly to host metabolism (Vacelet & Donadey 1977; Taylor et al. 2007). Microbial symbionts are acquired by vertical transmission (e.g. via gemmules) or from the surrounding environment [horizontal

transmission (Schmitt et al. 2008; Sipkema et al. 2015)]. For the latter mode of symbiont acquisition, a cellular  recognition is required  that  discriminates  symbiont from nonsymbiotiv microorganisms. This acquisition could be mediated either via the specific recognition of symbionts by the sponge, and/or by the use of  sym- biont factors that avoid digestion by the filter-feeding sponge (Wilkinson et al. 1984).
The presence of eukaryotic-like proteins or proteins carrying eukaryotic domains in prokaryotes (so-called ELPs) has recently received increasing attention  for  their potential involvement in mediating host-micro- biome interactions (Gomez-Valero et al. 2013; Nguyen  et al. 2014). ELPs have received their name as they are typically found in high frequency in eukaryotes, but rarely in other domains of life (Cazalet et al. 2004; de



Felipe et al. 2005). ELPs are thought to be laterally transferred from eukaryotes to prokaryotes and then evolved in the recipient organism, while still having recognizable eukaryotic sequence signatures (Bork 1993; Lurie-Weinberger et al. 2010). Domains found in ELPs, such as the ankyrin repeats or tetratricopeptide repeats, often mediate protein-protein interactions in cellular processes, including those involved in establishing an intracellular   lifestyle   (BruEURggemann   et al.   2006).   The involvement of ELPs in pathogenicity, intracellular sur- vival and replication has been demonstrated  or  postu- lated for several important bacterial pathogens and symbionts, such as Legionella pneumophila, Coxiella burnetii, Ehrlichia canis and Wolbachia pipientis (Iturbe- Ormaetxe et al. 2005; Mavromatis et al. 2006; Habyari- mana et al. 2008; Pan et al. 2008; Voth et al. 2009; LuEURhrmann   et al.   2010;  Richards   et al.   2013).  Recently, four ankyrin repeat ELPs from an uncultured gammaproteobacterial symbiont of a sponge were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and were shown to modulate phagocytosis by amoeba, thus promoting the intracellular  survival  of  bacteria  (Nguyen et al. 2014).
In fact, genes for ELPs have been found in high frequency in the genomes of bacterial symbionts from different sponge species, including Theonella swinhoei, Ircinia variabilis, Aplysina aerophoba, Carteriospongia foliascens and Haliclona cymaeformis (Gao et al. 2014; Kamke et al. 2014; Tian et al. 2014; Burgsdorf  et al. 2015). Specifically, ELP containing domains of the classes tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR), ankyrin repeats (ANK), leucine-rich repeats (LRR) and  NCL-1,  HT2A and Lin-41 repeats (NHL) were more abundant in the bacterial symbionts of the marine sponge Cymbastella concentrica, Tedania anhelens and Scopalina sp. in com- parison with free-living bacteria  (Thomas  et al.  2010; Fan et al. 2012). A metaproteomic study showed the expression  of one  ANK  protein  and  one  TPR  protein in the symbiont community of C. concentrica (Liu et al. 2012). Proteins levels of fibronectin type III (FN3) and NipSnap domains were also found to decrease under thermal stress in the sponge Rhopaloeides odorabile (Fan et al. 2013). While these results  provide  support  that ELPs have a  function  in  natural  symbiont  communi- ties, the limited resolution and sensitivity of metapro- teomic approaches likely gives an incomplete  picture about the number of expressed ELPs and their  expression levels.
Metatranscriptomics   can   provide   insight   into   the
expression of thousands of genes, and hence can give a more complete picture of the expression patterns of  ELPs in sponge symbionts. However, metatranscrip- tomic approaches face two major challenges when used in host-microbiome systems. First, common to any

transcriptome study, there is a large abundance of ribo- somal RNA (rRNA) relative to messenger RNA (mRNA), which needs to be removed, because other- wise sequence data will be dominated by functionally  uninformative rRNA (Radax et al. 2012; Fiore et al. 2015). A number of methods are available for rRNA removal (Stewart 2013), and two of the most successful strategies involve exonuclease digestion of the  rRNA and subtractive hybridization with probes complemen- tary to conserved motifs in the rRNA. These two  methods have been extensively used with microbial iso- lates or enriched communities (e.g. He et al. 2010; Yi    et al. 2011; Giannoukos et al. 2012; Peano et al. 2013; Bhagwat et al. 2014), but there is little information on their performance in host-symbiont systems (Moitinho- Silva et al. 2014; Versluis et al. 2015).
The second challenge is the separation of host and microbiome mRNA pools. Samples processed for meta- transcriptomics have to be rapidly frozen in order to ensure that the data obtained reflect the true expression levels, as extensive postsampling separation  of  microbial cells is likely to alter the mRNA profile (Frias-Lopez et al. 2008). This means that the host and microbiome mRNA pools have to be separated both during RNA isolation and after sequencing using bioin- formatics. The former can make use of the poly(A) tails found in eukaryotic mRNA transcripts by hybridization and subsequent separation with oligo(dT) probes. How- ever, this step may not be completely efficient,  and  thus, host-associated metatranscriptomes treated  this way often contain a significant portion of contaminant sequences from the host (Schmieder & Edwards 2011a). Postsequencing, transcripts from microorganisms can be identified bioinformatically by comparison to available reference genomes, but in the case of novel or divergent transcripts this may not be efficient. Alternatively, alignment-free algorithms based on the difference of oligonucleotide composition between prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes can also be applied (Dick et al.  2009; Mohammed et al. 2011). These steps are particu- larly critical here when investigating prokaryotic tran- scripts with orthology to eukaryotic sequences, as inadequate removal of host transcripts would result in ELPs falsely identified as belonging to prokaryotic symbionts.
The  aim  of  this  study  was  therefore  to  develop  a
metatranscriptomic protocol and analysis pipeline to detect ELP expression in sponge microbiomes. To mini- mize the amount of nontarget sequences (i.e. rRNA and host mRNA), we tested different methods of rRNA removal and combined this with the removal of poly(A) tailed mRNA. We then conducted careful bioinformatic analyses that included in silico subtraction of eukaryotic sequences   and   analyses   of   sequence   signatures (i.e.



tetranucleotide composition). We identified a large  set  of transcripts that belonged to various ELP classes with high confidence of being expressed by bacterial and archaeal symbionts.

Materials and methods
A flow diagram summarizing the methods is shown in Fig. 1. A methodological pipeline was initially devel- oped with the Cymbastella concentrica (Cym) samples, and when a suitable protocol was established (see results), this was used for Scopalina sp (Sco) and Tedania anhelens (Ted) samples.

Sampling and total RNA extraction
Three individuals each of the sponges C. concentrica, Scopalina sp. and T. anhelens were collected at a depth of 9 metres at Bare Island in Botany Bay, New South  Wales  (33deg  590S,  151deg  140E).  Individuals  were  collected in separate plastic bags and brought to the shore where they were quickly rinsed and squeezed in filtered sea-  water and then immediately snap frozen in liquid nitro- gen. From each of the three individuals, two similar  sized pieces (~100 mg) of sponge tissue (including mesohyl and pinacoderm) were crushed into small  pieces in the presence of liquid nitrogen and processed independently as technical replicates.
Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol  (Invitrogen  Life Technologies) following the manufacturer's instructions and using  a  mix  of  1.4-  and  0.1-mm beads (MOBio) for the homogenization of samples. Extracted RNA was further purified using the  Pure-  Link RNA Mini Kit  (Ambion)  and  treated  with  DNase I to remove genomic DNA. RNA extractions were subject to PCR using prokaryotic universal 16S rRNA gene primers to check for DNA contamination. Total RNA was quantified with Nanodrop spectropho- tometry and  Qubit  fluorometry  as  well  as  analysed  by capillary electrophoresis on a 2100 Bioanalyzer Instrument (Agilent Technologies).

Construction of the eukaryotic library and sequencing
For the construction of cDNA libraries from the sponge host, aliquots of the total RNA from the three individu- als of the same sponge species were pooled and pro- cessed with the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit protocol, which contains a poly(A) RNA selection step with oligo(dT) beads to enrich for eukaryotic mRNA fragments. Sequencing was con- ducted on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform with 100-bp paired-end reads at the Ramaciotti Centre for Genomics UNSW).

Construction of the microbiome library and sequencing
For the microbiome libraries, total RNA samples were depleted of eukaryotic mRNA using the Dynabeads Oligo(dT)25 (Ambion). The prokaryotic RNA in the supernatant was further purified with  the  PureLink  RNA Mini Kit including a second DNase I treatment (Ambion). These samples were split into two aliquots to apply two different rRNA removal protocols: (i) sub- tractive hybridization with bacteria-specific probes attached to magnetic beads (Ribo-Zero Bacteria Kit, Epi- centre)  or  (ii)  digestion  with  a  50-phosphate-dependent exonuclease (Terminator, Epicentre). rRNA removal using Ribo-Zero (treatment RZ) was performed accord- ing to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, RNA was incubated with the oligonucleotide mix in binding buf- fer for 10 min at 68 degC. Magnetic beads were allowed to hybridize for 10 min. The beads with  bound  rRNA  were discarded, and the supernatant was precipitated with ethanol. For removal of rRNA by enzymatic diges- tion (treatment TM), RNA was digested with  the enzyme at 30 degC for 60 min following the manufac- turer's protocol and the reaction was terminated by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The result- ing RNA from both approaches was used for library construction and sequenced as above, but without the poly(A) selection step.


Quality filtering and rRNA removal
Sequencing data were filtered and demultiplexed with CASAVA v1.8.2. Possible adaptor contaminations were trimmed using the software package TRIMMOMATIC v0.33 (Bolger et al. 2014). Forward and reverse reads were quality filtered using the PRINSEQ software v0.20.4 (Sch- mieder & Edwards 2011b) by removing poor-quality base  calls  in  iterative  5-nt  windows  from  the  50 and  30 ends  of  each  read  with  a  mean  quality  score  less  than
20. Moreover, sequences with entropy lower than 7 (dust parameter) or with any ambiguous nucleotide (base = N) were removed. For the sponge transcrip- tome, poly(A) tails were removed with the 'trim-tail' option. After trimming, reads shorter than 70 base pairs  (bp) in length were discarded. For the prokaryotic  data  sets, sequences were checked for rRNA  contamination with SORTMERNA software v1.99 (Kopylova et al.  2012) using the Silva NR Ref 121 database (Quast et al. 2013) and 'feeling-lucky' alignment option. Efficiency between treatments (RZ and TM) was compared  using  a  t-test. The rRNA sequences were further classified with the Bayesian naEURive classifier (Wang et al. 2007) in MOTHUR v1.37.3 (Schloss et al. 2009) using the Silva NR Ref 121 database 16S/18S (SSU) and 23S/28S (LSU) taxonomic outlines  and  a  60%  confidence  threshold.

did not align with the reference database were consid- ered as putative mRNA.

Eukaryotic and microbiome assembly
To generate a eukaryotic transcriptome (Fig. 1B), the quality-filtered eukaryotic reads were de novo assembled with the TRINITY software v2.0.6 (Grabherr et al. 2011). Trinity was chosen for its good performance for both transcriptomes and metatranscriptomes in benchmark studies (Jain et al. 2013; Celaj et al. 2014). De novo assem- bly was conducted with default settings for strand-speci- fic, paired-end reads and a minimum transcript length    of 150 bp. Reads were aligned back to the final assembly with the bowtie_PE_separate_then_join.pl script from the TRINITY package. CD-HIT-EST v4.6.4 (Li & Godzik 2006) was used to assess redundancy in the assembly for iden- tical sequences (parameter "c" = 1) based on a word size of 8. Transcripts were searched with BlastX against the nonredundant NCBI database. Transcripts with hit E-values < 1.0E-5 were taxonomically classified with MEGAN v5.11.3 (Huson et al. 2007) using the lowest com- mon ancestor algorithm  (LCA)  with  settings  min  score = 50, max expected = 1.0E-5, top per cent = 10 and LCA per cent = 100. Transcripts classified as bacterial or archaeal were removed from the assembly before further analysis (with E-value < 1.0E-3).
The microbiome mRNA reads from treatment RZ (RZ-reads) and TM (TM-reads) were mapped  against the eukaryotic transcriptome assembly using BOWTIE2 v2.2.4 (Langmead & Salzberg 2012). Any read mapping the eukaryotic transcriptome with a minimum default score  of  -60  was  removed.  The  remaining  reads  were pooled within each rRNA removal methods (RZ and TM). De novo assembly of microbiome mRNA reads was performed with the same parameters  as  used  for the sponge data, except the 'jaccard_clip' option  was also used to prevent formation of long chimeric tran- scripts. The microbiome transcriptomes generated were named after the rRNA method used in their construc-  tion, that is Meta-Cym-RZ and Meta-Cym-TM.

Quantification of transcript expression
Transcript abundance in samples was estimated with  RSEM v1.2.21 (Li & Dewey 2011), which implements the Bowtie aligner (Langmead et al. 2009). Counts per mil- lion (CPM), calculated as the estimated read counts divided by the library sizes and multiplied by one mil- lion, were used to calculate the Pearson's correlation coefficient among technical replicates and visualized using scatterplots. Transcript expression levels were expressed as transcripts per million (TPM), where esti- mated read counts are normalized by library size and

transcript length to compare among different tran- scripts. A cross-sample normalization (TMM) was also applied to compare between individuals (Robinson & Oshlack 2010; Dillies et al. 2013).
Differential expression analysis was conducted with
EDGER package v3.8.6 (Robinson et al. 2010) in R
 Generalized linear models (GLM) with negative binomial distributions were con- structed for each transcript using the technical repli- cates within each individual to examine variation between individuals, that is biological variation. A caveat of this approach was that technical and unex- plained variations were lumped together in the resid- ual term of the GLM. Observed library size was normalized by applying scaling factors (trimmed mean of M-values, TMM) computed internally by edgeR functions.

Comparison of metatranscriptomes from different rRNA removal methods
To compare the metatranscriptome information recov- ered from both rRNA removal methods,  we  applied  two levels of comparisons. First, we compared the simi- larity of both full-length assembled metatranscriptomes by clustering sequences using the USEARCH algorithm (Edgar 2010) with 90% similarity and >70% sequence alignment length. Second, we compared the transcript expression of the metatranscriptomes when using each set of reads (from the RZ and TM methods). To do this, RZ-reads from all three individuals were combined and used to estimate the transcript abundance of the Meta- RZ and Meta-TM using RSEM. Likewise, all three sets of TM-reads were pooled to estimate the transcript abundance of both metatranscriptomes.

Decontaminant steps of the metatranscriptomes
The metatranscriptome from RZ (Meta-RZ) was chosen as the reference assembly for further analyses given the superior representation of transcripts  compared  with  the Meta-TM assembly (see Results and Discussion). Meta-RZ transcripts were searched using BlastX against the nonredundant NCBI database. Transcripts with hit E-value < 1.0E-5 were analysed with MEGAN as above (Huson et al. 2007) to infer the lowest common ancestor (LCA). Homology to noncoding RNA families was detected using an INFERNAL software v1.1 (Nawrocki & Eddy 2013) search of the RFAM 12.0 database (Nawrocki et al. 2015), which returns conservation scores of both the sequence and the secondary structure of the RNA query. At this point, we performed additional decon- taminating steps on the Meta-RZ (Fig. 1C). Transcripts were searched using BlastN against the host



transcriptome to detect any residual eukaryotic sequences. Positive hits (>= 90% sequence  similarity  over >= 70% coverage) were removed from the data set. Furthermore, we mapped the eukaryotic reads to the Meta-RZ using Bowtie2 and removed transcripts with a depth of >=1 read covering at least 50% of the length.

Analysis of ELPs
Protein-coding regions within the assembled transcripts were predicted with the TransDecoder script within the Trinity platform, including homology searches  (sequence and protein databases) as  retention  criteria  for open reading frames (ORF). The resulting ORFs  were searched for eukaryotic-like domains using the INTERPROSCAN tool v5.16-55.0 (Jones et al. 2014). The tar- get domains were as follows: ankyrin repeats (ANK), cadherin repeats (CAD), fibronectin type III (FN3), leu- cine-rich repeats (LRR), NCL-1, HT2A and Lin-41 repeats (NHL),  pyrrolo-quinoline  quinone  repeat (PQQ), tetratricopeptide/Sel1-like repeats (TPR/SEL1), wd40 repeat (WD40) and NipSnap family. Appendix S1 (Supporting information) lists all accession numbers related with each ELP class, plus a short description of them. Information of other known domains and repeats was also retained when they were part of transcripts encoding ELPs. Translocation and localization of pro- teins was predicted with SIGNALP v4.1 (Petersen et al. 2011) using default parameters for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Transmembrane domains were predicted with TMHMM v2.0 (Krogh et al. 2001).

Clustering sequences by tetranucleotide frequency and emergent self-organizing maps
Tetranucleotide frequencies were determined for each transcript using available Perl scripts (Dick et al. 2009). Large sequences were subdivided into 5-kb fragments, and the minimum length was set to 500 bp as sug-  gested by Dick et al. (2009). Emergent self-organizing maps (ESOMs) were applied to cluster and inspect tran- scripts according to the tetranucleotide frequencies. An ESOM is an unsupervised neural network algorithm specialized in converting high-dimensional data into easily perceivable two-dimensional maps (Kohonen  2001; Abe et al. 2003). We used this method imple- mented in the Databionic ESOM tools software v1.1 (Ultsch     &     MoEURrchen     2005)     following     previously described parameters (Dick et al. 2009). Briefly, tetranu- cleotide frequencies were transformed with the 'Robust ZT'  option  and  trained  with  the  k-Batch  algorithm  (k = 0.15%) for 20 training epochs. The standard best- match search method was used with a local best-match search radius of 8. Maps were visualized as U-Matrix,

where background colour represents the distance in tetranucleotide frequency between data points. Data points representing the transcripts were coloured according to their taxonomy as assessed by MEGAN,  and bin territories were defined manually around the apparent clustering.

Results and discussion

Evaluation of rRNA depletion methods for metatranscriptomics
We initially evaluated the performance of two rRNA removal methods, Ribo-Zero (RZ)  and  Terminator  (TM) on 5 lg of non polyadenylated RNA from the sponge Cymbastella concentrica. All samples had initial total RNA integrity numbers (RIN) greater than 8.9, which  indicated  good   quality,   undegraded   RNA (Fig. S1, Supporting information). After the rRNA removal process, the decrease of rRNA peaks was visualized by electropherograms. For the RZ samples, peaks corresponding to rRNA species were largely absent, while for the TM samples, a wide peak in the  area possibly corresponding to the intact or partially degraded 23S/28S rRNA was still present. These  putative rRNA peaks could not be removed with a second round of nuclease treatment (Fig. S1, Support- ing information).
An average of 18 (+-2.1) and 21 (+-1.8) million paired-
end 101-bp reads were generated from the samples trea- ted with the RZ and TM protocol, respectively. After quality filtering, an average of 89.6% (+-2.5) and 88.5% (+-2.7) of sequences remained for each method.  Of  these, a mean of 42% of the RZ-reads and 85% of the  TM-reads could be aligned to  rRNA  reference sequences (Fig. S2, Table S1, Supporting information). The difference in the efficiency of rRNA removal between  the  two  treatments  was  significant  (t = 20,  df = 10, P < 0.001). This was consistent with the better performance of subtractive hybridization compared to exonuclease treatment found previously using cultured bacteria (He et al. 2010; Giannoukos et al. 2012). Of the rRNA sequences that were identified, a low percentage was prokaryotic (2.4% and 5.7%, on average, for RZ  and TM, respectively), while a much larger percentage were eukaryotic (37.5% and 74.5%, Fig. S2, Supporting information). The high abundance of rRNA sequences still present in the TM method resulted in a relatively  smaller size of the final mRNA data set for this method, 3 million of reads, on average, compared with 10 mil- lion reads for the RZ method (Table S2, Supporting information). There were also differences in depletion efficiencies with respect to taxonomic classification of rRNA reads (Appendix S2, Supporting information).



A recent metatranscriptome study of the sponge Crambe crambe (Versluis et al. 2015) used a similar strat- egy of removing poly(A) tailed sequences as applied here, followed by two Ribo-Zero removal kits (human/ mouse.rat and meta-bacteria) in an attempt to remove both eukaryotic and prokaryotic rRNA. This effort resulted in 18% of the final sequencing reads being rRNA. However, the very low amount of RNA obtained required the subsequent cDNA synthesis to be per- formed with the Ovation RNA-Seq system (NuGEN), which has been shown to introduce several biases affecting gene expression profiles and thus preventing quantitative analysis (Alberti et al. 2014). Another study used sample-specific probes for the rRNA removal that had to be experimentally generated in the laboratory (Moitinho-Silva et al. 2014). Approximately 26% of the sequence reads were still identified as rRNA; however, the direct comparison of this value with our results can- not be made as their bioinformatic  analysis  included  the removal of 'artificial duplicate reads' (Gomez- Alvarez et al. 2009), which likely also removed natural rRNA duplicates (Niu et al. 2010) and thus underesti-  mated the true level of rRNA sequences. Using similar sample-specific probes for hydrothermal vent snail sym- bionts resulted in 37-79% of reads matching rRNA (Sanders et al. 2013), which is generally higher than that observed here (~40% for RZ treatment). Together, our results and previous studies indicate that commercial probes targeting bacterial rRNA as supplied by the Ribo-Zero kit appear to be equally useful as sample- specific probes, but with the added advantage of reduc- ing time and resources to generate such probes.


Eukaryotic and microbiome transcriptomes of
C. concentrica
Generally, prior to the construction of the metagenomic or metatranscriptomic assemblies, it is necessary to per- form an in silico filtering step to remove contaminant  eukaryotic reads (host-mapping subtraction) that could cause misassembly of contigs (Schmieder & Edwards 2011a). Filtering can also dramatically reduce the requirement  for  sequence  homology  searches  (Daly   et al. 2015). Such filtering is usually performed using reference genomes of the host, and this has been exten- sively used for human samples (i.e. Kostic et al. 2011; Moore et al. 2011). However, in our case, no reference genomes for the sponge species investigated were avail- able, and sponge tissue often contains other eukaryotes, such as fungi or diatoms (Taylor et al. 2007), whose genome might also be absent from existing databases. Therefore, searches against reference databases  are likely to be ineffective in filtering out nonsymbiont sequences. We thus sequenced the poly(A) RNA from

sponge tissue, which likely included the transcriptomic reads of the sponges and other associated eukaryotes, and used this as a reference for the in silico host- mapping subtraction (see Fig. 1C).
We generated 37 million quality-filtered reads for the poly(A) mRNA that assembled into 184 053 transcripts with an N50 of 968 nt and included 90.5% of the original reads (Table S1, Supporting information). The assembled transcriptome was checked for duplication with CD-HIT, which detected only 432 duplicated sequences, consistent with a previous finding of low duplication rates for the Trinity assembler (Jain et al. 2013). As some prokaryotic mRNA may also have poly(A) tails (Sarkar 1997) or could have been unspecifically bound to the poly(T) probe, we searched the transcripts against the NR data- base and removed 2257 transcripts with a positive hit (BlastX, E-value < 1.0E-3) against prokaryotes.
For the host-mapping subtraction, the poly(A)- and rRNA-depleted prokaryotic reads were then mapped against this de novo eukaryotic transcriptome using Bowtie2. Of the prokaryotic reads that mapped against the eukaryotic transcriptome (minimum bowtie default score of -60), the largest fraction had a score of 0, indi- cating   perfect   matches.   Only   few   had   scores   of   -5 (equivalent to approximately 99% similarity) or lower (Fig. S4, Supporting Information). Mapped reads repre- sented approximately 45% and 69% in the  RZ-reads  and TM-reads data sets, respectively, showing that a large proportion of putative microbiome reads were in fact eukaryotic. The remaining unmapped reads (27 vs.   4 million for RZ and TM) were assembled with Trinity and produced 383 648 transcripts, with a N50 of 509 nt for RZ (Meta-Cym-RZ), and 130 904 with N50 of 358 nt for TM (Meta-Cym-TM). The assembly included 75% and 61% of the initial reads for the Meta-Cym-RZ and Meta-Cym-TM data, respectively. Technical repro- ducibility between replicates of each individual  was  high for both Meta-Cym-RZ and Meta-Cym-TM (Pear- son  correlation  coefficients  (rho) > 0.94,  see  Appendix S3, Supporting Information). However, the Meta-Cym-TM data set was largely a subset of the Meta-Cym-RZ data set. Therefore, further analysis was only performed with the Meta-Cym-RZ data set, which we considered to be superior.
To examine the expression profiles among technical and biological replicates of C. concentrica individuals, negative binomial generalized linear models (GLMs) were constructed for each transcript and examined sepa- rately. Generally, deviation attributed to biological varia- tion was only slightly greater than technical variation (Fig. S7A, Supporting information), where the technical variation was considered very low given the high repro- ducibility and correlation of technical replicates (Appendix S3, Supporting information). This indicates



relatively consistent expression of transcripts between individuals of the same sponge species. Transcripts encoding ELPs also showed a low variability between individual sponges (Fig. S7B, Supporting Information), which indicates they behave no different to other tran- scripts and are thus likely being constitutively expressed. A sequence similarity search (BlastX) of the Meta- Cym-RZ assembly detected 27.8% of transcripts with similarity to known proteins (E-value < 1.0E-5). Taxo- nomic analyses of these sequences using the LCA algo- rithm implemented in MEGAN showed  that 46.3% of the assigned transcripts were classified as eukaryotes. This indicated that the pre-assembly host-mapping sub- traction of reads was not sufficient to remove all con- taminant eukaryotic reads in the microbiome set. Therefore, we applied a  further 'decontamination' step to remove any Meta-Cym-RZ transcript with similarity to eukaryotic transcripts or poly(A) mRNA reads (see Materials & Methods). This removed 35% of the Meta- Cym-RZ transcripts. Transcripts with virtually zero expression (i.e. incompletely assembled transcripts that did not recruit both pairs of PE reads) for all three indi- viduals independently were also removed (9% of tran- scripts). The final 'decontaminated' de novo reference Meta-Cym-RZ included 228 060 expressed transcripts (Table S1, Supporting information). Technical replicates for this 'decontaminated' Meta-Cym-RZ data set were still highly correlated (rho = 0.94, 0.99 and 0.99 for indi-
viduals 1, 2 and 3, respectively).
After the 'decontamination' steps, the number of tran- scripts assigned by the LCA method as eukaryotes decreased from 41 761 to 14 942 (with 4167 sequences being related to phylum Porifera). As we rigorously fil- tered out any reads or transcripts similar to our eukary- otic transcriptome, it is surprising that these transcripts were still assigned to Porifera or eukaryotes. It is possi- ble that these sequences have been wrongly assigned in the NCBI reference database, because they are from contaminant microbial symbionts in host genomes. For instance, a recent study of horizontal gene transfer  events of prokaryotes into the Amphimedon queenslandica sponge genome identified several potential prokaryotic contaminants (Conaco et al. 2016). However, this issue  is difficult to solve without the full genome context of the expressed transcripts, and therefore, we took the conservative approach of removing them from the analysis of ELPs.

Identification of ELP in the microbial metatrancriptomes of C. concentrica, Scopalina sp. and Tedania anhelens
The Transdecoder tool was used to predict open read-  ing frames (ORFs) for transcripts with sequence

similarity to prokaryotes (39 709 as classified by LCA method). From those, 66 987 ORFs were identified, including 900 ORFs encoding ELPs. This represented 2.3% of all prokaryotic transcripts (Table S1D, Support- ing information). Among the transcripts without sequence similarity to the NR database, the number of ORFs predicted was 130 650, including 594 ELPs. These transcripts without sequence similarity were also exam- ined for noncoding RNAs, but only 2.5% showed sequence similarity to the Rfam database.
As taxonomic assignment of transcripts might be impacted by the quality of the reference database, we further classified transcripts based on their tetranu- cleotide composition. Oligonucleotide frequency has been shown to be homogenous within a genome, but to differ between genomes of different species (Karlin et al. 1997; Deschavanne et al. 1999; Pride et al. 2003; Sand- berg et al. 2003). These genomic signatures are useful in the taxonomy-independent assignment of metagenomic sequence fragments to microbial taxa (Mande et al. 2012), where the use of tetramers has been shown to result in optimal taxonomic discrimination  as  opposed to other k-mer frequencies  (Pride  et al.  2003;  Bohlin  et al. 2008). Moreover, oligonucleotide frequencies cap- ture species-specific characteristic more effectively than GC content or codon usage (Sandberg et al. 2003).
Using emergent self-organizing maps (ESOMs), dif-
ferent 'taxonomic regions' were visualized by the clus- tering of transcripts based  on  tetranucleotide frequencies (Fig. 2). Due to length restriction of this clustering analysis (see Materials & Methods), only transcripts longer than 500 bp were analysed. Most of  the bacterial and archaeal transcripts clustered together, and this area was therefore defined as the 'prokaryotic region'. This region also included 2.3% of the tran- scripts without sequence similarity to the NR database, showing that part of the transcripts could encode for prokaryotic proteins whose sequences are not available  in current databases. For reference, eumetazoa  sequences (including Porifera) were located around this prokaryotic region together with the majority of the transcripts without sequence similarity. 333 (of 900) of the prokaryotic transcripts encoding ELPs could be inspected in the ESOM, of which 302 (90.7%) fell into the prokaryotic region (Fig. 2). This set of  transcripts was defined as high-confidence (HC) prokaryotic tran- scripts with ELPs. The other 31 transcripts that were located outside the prokaryotic region of the ESOM, together with the short transcripts that were not anal- ysed in the map (540 transcripts with < 500 bp), were  defined as a low-confidence (LC) group.
It is important to note that this compositional (e.g. tetranucleotide) analysis would not be sensitive enough to detect recently transferred eukaryotic-like domains, if

they constitute a large portion of the sequence in the assembled transcript. In that case,  transcripts  would  lack the compositional adaptation to the recipient gen- ome (Lawrence & Ochman 1997) and hence would still show an eukaryotic signature in our analysis. This is probably the case for the 31 transcripts encoding ELPs with similarity to prokaryotic sequences  that  were found in the eukaryotic region of the ESOM.
We applied the protocol optimized for C. concentrica (i.e. poly(A) pulling, rRNA removal with Ribo-Zero, bioinformatic filtering) to investigate the metatran- scriptome and ELP expression within the sponges Sco- palina sp. and T. anhelens. Considering the high technical reproducibility found for C. concentrica, only one technical replicate from three sponge individuals

was sequenced for each of these two species. The eukaryotic poly(A) mRNA was also  sequenced  from  the hosts mRNA to allow for host-specific sequence filtering. Briefly, the eukaryotic transcriptomes con- sisted of 101 828 and 128 286 transcripts for Scopalina sp. and T. anhelens, respectively (Table S1C, Support- ing information). For the metatranscriptomes, the per- centage of reads aligned to rRNA database was an average of 59 and 36% for Scopalina sp. and T. anhe- lens, respectively. The percentage of reads mapped to  their respective eukaryotic transcriptome was 62% for Scopalina sp. and 77% for T. anhelens (Table S1B, Sup- porting information). The final set of reads for these sponges was 9.2 and 3.9 million, respectively, which assembled into 94 173 (Meta-Sco-RZ) and 85 440



(Meta-Ted-RZ) transcripts, compared to 383 648 tran- scripts obtained for C. concentrica (Table S1D, Support- ing information). As we only had one replicate per individual, the number of pooled reads  used  to  build the metatranscriptome was smaller than for C. concen- trica (i.e. 27 million), which could have influenced the size of the metatranscriptomes obtained. The microbial communities in Scopalina sp. and T. anhelens  are known to be much simpler than the ones in C. con- centrica (Fan et al. 2012) and this  could  also explain the lower number of transcripts.
After the 'decontamination' steps using the eukary- otic transcriptomes and after taxonomy assignment of transcripts, we obtained 8665 transcripts with sequence similarity to prokaryotes for Scopalina sp. and 3080 tran- scripts for T. anhelens. With respect to ORFs identified in these prokaryotic transcripts (Table S1D, Supporting information), 118 ORFs from the Met-Sco-RZ and 40 ORFs from the Meta-Ted-RZ contained ELPs represent- ing 1.4% and 1.3% of all prokaryotic transcripts, respec- tively. An average of 94% of the transcripts encoding  ELPs from Meta-Sco-RZ were located in the 'prokary- otic region' of the self-organizing maps (Fig. S8, Sup- porting information), which was considered as the HC group. In the case of Meta-Ted-RZ, we did not perform an ESOM analysis, as only seven transcripts encoding ELPs were longer than the minimum length for the analysis (i.e. 500 bp).

Comparison of prokaryotic taxa expressing ELPs
Before analysing the taxonomic affiliation of transcripts encoding ELPs, we compared the general taxonomic content (defined using the LCA method in MEGAN) of each sponge microbiome to previous metagenomic (Fan et al. 2012) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies (Esteves et al. 2016) of these sponges. Both studies found that Phyllobacteriaceae (order Rhizobiales) was abundant in C. concentrica, which is consistent with our observation of  their  high  expression  of  transcripts (Fig. 3). Similarly, the high number of transcripts assigned to the order Rhodobacterales was consistent with the high abundance of this taxa based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing (Esteves et al. 2016). The metatranscriptome of Scopalina sp. was also taxonomically dominated by similar groups found by 16S rRNA gene analyses (i.e. Oceanospirillales and other Gammaprotebacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Cyanobacteria). For T. anhelens, sequences assigned to Betaproteobacteria were dominant in both the metatranscriptome and the metagenome. This suggested that the majority of associated bacteria in the sponges are active in situ. However, differences were also found. Specifically, some taxa were more abundant in the metatranscriptome of T. anhelens in comparison with its

previous metagenomic analysis (Fan et al. 2012), includ- ing Thaumarchaeota, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria and Actinobacteria. This could indicate that some low-abun- dance or uncommon groups of prokaryotes are still rela- tively active, yet methodological factors between studies could also potentially contribute to such differences between results.
A broad range of taxa was observed to express ELPs among the three sponge species (Fig. 3). The percent-  age of transcripts encoding ELPs associated with any phylogenetic group broadly reflected the percentage of non-ELPs encoding transcripts for the same group for
C. concentrica, but varied for Scopalina sp. and T. anhe- lens (see Fig. S9, Supporting information). For instance, the most frequent transcripts encoding ELPs in C. con- centrica were associated with the family Rhizobiales (21%) and Rhodobacterales (23%), which also included most of the non-ELP encoding transcripts from the microbiome. In Scopalina sp., Rhizobiales and Bac- teroidetes had the highest percentage transcripts encoding ELPs, but the most frequent non-ELP encod- ing transcripts were associated with other groups (e.g. Oscillatoriophycideae and Oceanospirillales). Likewise, several groups in T. anhelens had a high percentage of transcripts encoding ELPs, including Crenarchaeota, Nostocales and Prochlorales, but they did not  repre-  sent a large proportion of non-ELP encoding tran- scripts. These comparative results suggest that  ELPs  can be found broadly among the taxa inhabiting the sponge microbiome; however, some groups are appar- ently more likely to contain or express ELPs  than  others.

ELP classes expressed in the microbiomes
The C. concentrica microbiome showed the greatest diversity in the type of ELP classes expressed compared with the other two microbiomes (Fig. 4A). For this microbiome, cadherin (CAD) domains were most fre- quently found (42.8% of all transcripts encoding ELPs) followed by ELPs with TPR and the subfamily SEL1 repeats. These two ELP classes were also most fre- quently expressed in the Scopalina sp. microbiome. In contrast, ELPs of the ANK class were most frequent in the T. anhelans metatranscriptome followed by the TPR/SEL1 class, while some ELP classes were not detected (including the abundant  CAD  repeats  observed in the other two sponge microbiomes). The median expression levels of transcripts  encoding  each of the ELP classes were generally similar to each other and also similar to other non-ELP encoding transcripts (Table 1, Fig. 4). Furthermore, there was no apparent relationship between the taxonomic origin of the tran- scripts and the ELP class they encoded or their

expression values (Table S2, Supporting information), which indicates that each symbiont group is utilizing different ELPs classes to different extents.
Two recent studies have  also  noted  the  expression  of ELPs in sponge microbiomes, and among them, variable results were found. First, TPR and ANK were found to be abundantly expressed in the metatran- scriptome of Xestospongia muta (Fiore et al. 2015), while fibronectin type 3 (FN3) domains were frequent in the sponge microbiomes of Xestospongia testudinaria and Stylissa carteri (Ryu et al. 2016). However, both studies did not perform an in silico subtraction of the host transcriptome from the metatrancriptome or used com- positional information to assign transcripts encoding ELPs to a prokaryotic source, which makes host

contamination in the putative  ELP  data  set  quite  likely. A quantitative and  qualitative  comparison  to  our data set therefore has to be treated with caution. Nevertheless, there is clearly a large variability in the  expression of particular ELP classes between the microbiomes of different sponge species. Such variabil- ity in ELP repertoire might  reflect  the host specificity  of symbionts. This would be consistent with recent observations for the symbiotic bacterium Ca. Synecho- choccus spongiarum where the genomes of different phylotypes found in different sponges species also encoded for distinct sets of ELPs  (Burgsdorf  et al. 2015). Further studies are however required to fully appreciate the extent and variability of ELP expression  in sponge-associated microbiomes.

Domain architecture of ELPs and cotranscribed proteins

ELPs often contain additional functional domains  (Fan et al. 2012; Reynolds & Thomas 2016) that might pro- vide insight into their cellular or molecular  function.  We found that expressed ELPs of the classes ANK, NHL, PQQ, TPR/SEL1, WD40 and NipSnap were fre- quently (i.e. 30-60%) associated with predicted trans- membrane helices (TMHs) and/or signal peptides (SPs) (e.g. Fig. 5, Table S4, Supporting information). PQQ, TPR/SEL1-containing ORFs often also coded for domains related to the outer membrane b-barrel assem- bly machinery (Bam complex), which is involved in assembly and insertion of proteins into the outer mem- brane. Moreover, NHL, TPR/SEL1 and WD40 were

associated with several domains of the Tol-dependent translocation system (e.g. Fig. 5C). The Tol/Pal system  is involved in maintaining the outer membrane  integ- rity of Gram-negative bacteria (Lazzaroni et al. 1999) and are also involved in the pathogenesis of several bacteria (Dubuisson 2005; Godlewska et al. 2009). Genes for Tol-Pal systems were conserved during genome evolution of the obligate endosymbiont Blochmannia, while many others were lost rapidly after establishment of the symbiosis, suggesting their importance for host interactions (Williams & Wernegreen 2015). Together, this information indicates that many of the expressed ELPs found here are putatively localized outside the bacterial cytoplasm, which could facilitate their direct contact with surrounding cells and hence bacteria-host interactions.

Proteins with TPR motifs included many known domains, such as oxoglutarate/iron-dependent dioxyge- nase, glycosyl transferase family41, peptidase M48 and transglutaminase-like protein (Table S3, Supporting information). TPR-containing proteins are involved in a variety of functions vital to cell processes (D'Andrea & Regan 2003). In bacterial pathogens, TPR-containing proteins have been directly related to virulence-asso- ciated functions, such as the translocation of virulence factors into host cells, adhesion to host cells, and block- ing  of  phagolysosomal  maturation  (BroEURms  et al.  2006; Edqvist et al. 2006; Chakraborty et al. 2008). Chaperons and effectors of the Type III secretion systems (T3SS) or proteins of the type IV pilus (Tfp) biogenesis are well- studied examples of TPR-containing proteins related to bacterial  pathogenesis  (Pallen  et al.  2003;  BuEURttner  et al. 2008; Job et al. 2010; Salomonsson et al. 2011; Cerveny et al. 2013). Some of our TPR-containing transcripts were associated with the T3SS and Tfp proteins mediat- ing host-microbiome interaction (e.g. Fig. 5A-B), and they were expressed above the general mean of the prokaryotic transcripts (Table S4, Supporting informa- tion), indicating a potential important role for the sym- biont microbiome.
Proteins with WD40 repeats included enzymatic domains related with bacterial respiration, such as cyto- chrome c for aerobic respiration or nitrous oxide reduc- tase, which is activated by anaerobic conditions. Cytochrome c domain were also found to be associated with PQQ in the microbial metagenomes of six different sponge species (Fan et al. 2012). Other domains, such as caspase, sialidases or subtilisin proteases, were also pre- sent in PQQ-containing ELPs. Caspases are mainly involved in mediating cell death (apoptosis) in eukary- otes, but they have also been found in bacterial patho- gens (Gautam & Sharma 2002). Our caspase-like domains were also found co-occurring with domains similar to Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane pro- teins and peptidoglycan-binding domains, further sup- porting their prokaryotic nature (Rice & Bayles 2008; Asplund-Samuelsson 2015). Cyanobacterial caspase homologs have been previously found to be associated with WD40 repeats (Asplund-Samuelsson 2015). Their function in prokaryotes is largely unexplored,  and  in  the host-associated context, they might play a role in bacterial pathogenesis and host interaction by mimick- ing eukaryotic caspases and promoting cell survival (Wall & McCormick 2014). Sialidases have been consid- ered virulence factors in many pathogenic organisms, which colonize mucosal surfaces by hydrolysing the protective barrier and facilitating bacterial adhesion (Corfield 1992; Wiggins et al. 2001). Subtilisin-like serine proteases are extracellular peptidases  produced  by  many bacterial pathogens, which degrade the host

extracellular matrix facilitating invasion and coloniza- tion (Bonifait et al. 2010; Kennan et al. 2010).
The    metatranscriptomic    assembly    produced many polycistronic transcripts, which allowed us to investigate what biological or cellular processes are co-expressed and coregulated with ELP genes. TonB-dependent transporter (TBDTs) genes were often cotranscribed with ELPs genes of the TPR and ANK families (e.g. Fig. 5D). In bacterial outer membranes (OM), these transporters can bind and take up iron complexes (Moeck & Coulton 1998; Hopkinson & Bar- beau 2012), vitamin B12 and B1 (Rodionov et al. 2002; Shultis et al. 2006) and various other substrates (Schauer et al. 2008). The twin-arginine translocation pathway was found cotranscribed with genes of the ANK, NHL, PQQ, TPR/SEL1 and WD40 classes (e.g. Fig. 5E). This translocation system exports fully folded proteins across cytoplasmic bacterial membranes into the periplasmic space, where they are subsequently transferred to  the OM or secreted into the extracellular space by a dedi-  cated OM-spanning secretion system. One of the sys- tems that can export folded proteins across the OM is   the bacterial type II secretion system, which was also found cotranscribed with TPR/SEL1 (Fig. 5B). Another cotranscribed secretion system was the P pilus biogene- sis type IV (Fig. 5A), which is evolutionarily related to the T2SS, but extends into the extracellular compart- ment to promote cell adherence, cell motility and DNA transport (Costa et al. 2015). Tol-Pal and Bam complex proteins were found to be cotranscribed with TPS/ SEL1-type ELPs in the metatranscriptome of Scopalina sp, while in T. anhelens NHL-type ELPs were co-expressed with TolB-like proteins. Overall, these findings show cotranscription of ELPs with transport systems that could facilitate their interaction with the extracellular environment or other cells.

Conclusion
In this study, we detected the simultaneous expression of up to 900 different ELPs in the microbiome of a sponge (i.e. Cymbastella concentrica). To achieve this, we gener- ated an adequate coverage of prokaryotic mRNA as well as conducted careful bioinformatic analyses to classify ELPs correctly, that is identify those likely derived from prokaryotic symbionts. We showed that commercial probes can reduce rRNA to similar proportions as other protocols, allowing for a technically robust, amplifica- tion-independent processing of samples. Our analysis also showed that, despite an attempt to remove eukary- otic mRNA with poly(A) pull-down, a significant fraction of transcripts were still found to be eukaryotic. This high- lights the potential of host sequence contamination in prokaryotic metatranscriptomes, which requires further



bioinformatics filtering steps. In our study, we defined a high-confidence set of ELPs from microbial symbionts that were expressed at levels and with variability that would imply their constitutive function. The enrichment of genes encoding for ELPs has been previously shown in the metagenome of C. concentrica, Scopalina sp. and Tedania anhelens (Thomas et al. 2010; Fan et al. 2012), and our results both confirm and measure their actual expres- sion by the symbiont community. Furthermore, quantita- tive analyses and taxonomic assignment of transcripts encoding ELPs indicated that (i) most of the taxa present in the sponge microbiome actively transcribe ELPs, (ii) the class of ELP encoded is not specific for any taxonomic group, (iii) variation in expression level is not related to ELP class (i.e. not one ELP class is consistently overex- pressed), and 4) ELP classes are expressed differently between sponge hosts. For many ELPs, we also found evidence of their function outside the cell's cytoplasm and some associated functions (either in the same protein or through polycistronic co-expression) that indicated bacteria-host interaction. Overall, our results further sup- port the notion that ELPs are important factors that sponge symbionts could use to control or facilitate their molecular interaction with their host.
