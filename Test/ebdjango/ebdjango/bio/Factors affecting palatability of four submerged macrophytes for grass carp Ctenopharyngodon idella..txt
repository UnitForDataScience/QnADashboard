Abstract Grass carp can weaken the growth and reproductive capacity of submerged macrophytes by consuming valuable tis- sues, but factors affecting palatability of submerged macrophytes for grass carp rarely are considered. In this study, relative con- sumption rate of grass carp with regard to submerged macro- phytes was in the following order: Hydrilla verticillata > Vallisneria natans > Ceratophyllum demersum > Myriophyllum spicatum. Firmness of macrophytes was in the following order:
M. spicatum > C. demersum > H. verticillata = V. natans, where- as shear force was M. spicatum > C. demersum > H. verticillata >
V. natans. After crude extracts of M. spicatum were combined with H. verticillata, grass carp fed on fewer macrophyte pellets that contained more plant secondary metabolites (PSMs). This indicated that structure and PSMs affected palatability of macrophytes.
PSMs do not contribute to reduction in palatability through inhibition of intestinal proteinases activity, but they can cause a decrease in the abundance of Exiguobacterium, Acinetobacter-yielding proteases, lipases, and cellulose ac- tivity, which in turn can weaken the metabolic capacity of grass carp and adversely affect their growth. Thus, the dis- advantages to the growth and development of grass carp

Introduction

As the main primary producers, submerged macrophytes play vital roles in freshwater ecosystems (Wang et al. ). They maintain ecological integrity and stability, reduce turbidity from sediments, and increase the diversity of the physical habitat (Genkai-Kato and Carpenter ; Bolduc et al. ). However, the growth and resultant biomass of macro- phytes are influenced by many factors, including nutrients, light, competition from other plants, and herbivorous fishes (Burks et al. ).
Several studies have demonstrated that herbivory has a great influence on macrophytes, especially when exotic herbi- vores are introduced. Common carp Cyprinus carpio, crayfish Procambarus clarkii and Orconectes rusticus, and snail Pomacea canaliculata can dramatically change freshwater habitats by reducing macrophyte abundance from consump- tion and destruction (Lodge et al. ; Wong et al. ; van der Wal et al. ; Bajer et al. ).

known for their high feeding rate, generally consume 25 to 100% of their body mass of macrophytes per day. This can have a large influence on macrophytes through weakening their growth and reproductive capacity and influencing their community succession (Dorenbosch and Bakker ). However, not all macrophytes are favored by grass carp as their palatability varies (Parker and Hay ).



To date, there have been many studies on the factors deter- mining the palatability of aquatic plants for grazers. Many of these reports suggest that the presence of deterrent secondary compounds in plants can result in the low feeding rates of herbivores. Kapuscinski et al. () found that soluble phe- nolic compounds negatively affected palatability for rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus. In addition, plants with high chemical deterrents exhibited low vulnerability to amphipod Ampithoe longimana and isopod Idotea chelipes (Taylor et al. ; Martinez-Crego et al. ). Herbivores are normally nitrogen-limited and prefer plants with a high protein content (Cruz-Rivera and Hay ; Sanchez and Trexler ). In ad- dition to secondary compounds and protein content, structural determinants of plants play an important role in palatability for herbivores (Elger and Willby ). Palatability of macrophytes for the snail Lymnaea stagnalis was negatively related to dry matter content (DMC), and the talitrid amphipod Orchestoidea tuberculata preferred fresh Macrocystis integrifolia over Lessonia nigrescens, because Lessonia nigrescens has firmer physical features (Elger and Lemoine ; Duarte et al. ). Although Parker et al. () have reported that plant secondary metabolites were associated with herbivory of grass carp, we know little about the mechanisms of palatability of submerged macrophytes for grass carp.
Some studies have focused on the relationship between traits of plants and their palatability for herbivores. However, these studies have examined how those traits interact to affect fitness of herbivores as it relates to survivorship, growth, and repro- duction over a relatively long period of time (Duarte et al. ; Tao et al. ). Nevertheless, the physiological reactions such as proteinase activity in aquatic herbivores due to different traits of plants, which may affect feeding intake, have been barely explored. It is well known that gut microbiota of fish can influ- ence biological processes, including digestion (Giatsis et al. ; Liu et al. ). However, there is a lack of research on the relationship between palatability of macrophytes and fish intestinal microbiota affected by macrophyte traits. Taken to- gether, further investigations are needed to elucidate the mech- anism of palatability of submerged macrophytes for grass carp and to provide useful information to develop strategies for the restoration of submerged macrophytes in ecosystems contain- ing herbivorous fishes.
We here measured the relative consumption rate (RCR) of grass carp with regard to four submerged macrophytes: Hydrilla verticillata (H. verticillata), Vallisneria natans (V. natans), Ceratophyllum demersum (C. demersum), and Myriophyllum spicatum (M. spicatum). Each submerged mac- rophyte was further analyzed for physical, nutritional, and chemical traits to assess whether any of these parameters were correlated with palatability for grass carp. Additionally, we investigated the effect of crude extracts from the least palat- able plant (M. spicatum) on the activity of intestinal protein- ases and the gut bacterial community.

Methods

Study organisms

During spring time (March 2016), grass carp (mean +- SD, weight 80 +- 5 g; total length 19 +- 0.5 cm) were purchased from the Xiantao County Fishery, Hubei Province, China (30deg 27' N, 113deg 52' E) and reared in laboratory conditions for 1 week before experiments. All animal experiments were approved
by the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Approval ID: IHB 2013724) and were conducted in accordance with the Guiding Principles for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Four species of submerged macrophytes (H. verticillata, V. natans, C. demersum, and M. spicatum) were collected from East Lake, Wuhan City, China (30deg 53' N, 114deg
38' E). Before the experiment, running tap water was used to
flush away marl and periphyton coverage on the macrophytes.

Feeding assays

Fee d in g a ssa ys wer e p e rf orm e d i n a q u ar ia (100 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm), in which the flow rate of recirculating water of 26 degC was maintained at 25 L min -1 and the water was filtered through biofilters to remove fish feces and to reduce the ammonia concentration. To avoid stressful conditions caused by low oxygen concentrations, aeration was maintained at a constant level in aquaria. In each aquarium, there were five grass carp that have been fed pond food for 2 days of acclimatization (Dorenbosch and Bakker ). Before feeding assays, grass carp had been starved for 24 h. During the experiments, grass carp were permitted to feed for 2 h and there was no mortality of grass carp.

Feeding assay with fresh submerged macrophytes

Each of four species of fresh submerged macrophytes (100 g) was added to six aquaria, with six replicates for each species for a total of 24 aquaria. Given autogenic mass change in the macrophytes, the paired control in other six aquaria contained water and macrophytes without grass carp. After removing excess water with a paper towel, we weighed macrophyte biomass at the beginning and the end of the experiment. The
percent RCR was calculated as [H0 x Cf/C0 - Hf]/W x 100%,
where H0 and Hf were the wet masses of macrophytes exposed to grass carp before and after the experiment, respectively; C0 and Cf were the wet masses of macrophytes from the paired control before and after experiment, respectively; W was the mass of grass carp (Wong et al. ).

Feeding assay with reconstituted macrophytes

To control for plant structure, each species of fresh macro- phytes was lyophilized at - 70 degC for 24 h to a constant weight



and then finely ground to a homogeneous consistency by sieving through a 149-mm mesh screen. First, heating agar and distilled water were put in a microwave oven until they melt, then the resulting plant material from each species was added to the mixture and stirred evenly to a final ratio of 1 g plant material: 5 mL water: 0.5 g agar. This agar-based food was formed into a uniform cylinder of 2 mm diameter using a mold. After it solidified, we cut the cylinder into pellets of 7 mm size.
In assays using the artificial pellets, each of the four types of pellets was added to six aquaria, with six replicates for each type for a total of 24 aquaria. The number of pellets provided to the grass carp before experiment was counted as N0 and the number of pellets remaining after the experiment was Nf. RCR was then calculated and expressed as a percentage of each type of pellet using the formula (Nf - N0)x G/W x 100%, where G was the weight of each pellet; W was the mass of grass carp (Miller and Provenza ).

Feeding assay with PSMs

According to the results of two feeding assays above, very little M. spicatum was consumed either in the form of fresh plant or reconstituted pellets; therefore, we added its crude extracts into H. verticillata (the most palatable plant) to assess whether PSMs influenced palatability for grass carp in the third assay.
For M. spicatum, five different masses (0, 1.25, 2.5, 3.75, and 5 g) of lyophilized and ground plant powder were extract- ed in 70% ethanol three times for 24 h each, followed by further extraction with petroleum ether thrice (exhibiting a boiling range of 30-60 degC) to remove chlorophyll and lipid. These crude extracts were concentrated by rotary evaporation and then we got five concentrations of crude extracts named 0 PSMs, 0.25 PSMs, 0.50 PSMs, 0.75 PSMs, and 1.00 PSMs.
These crude extracts were added to 5 g of H. verticillata pow- der separately. Five different food pellets were prepared and RCR was calculated for each type of pellet as described above.

Measurement of plant traits

To understand the palatability of submerged macrophytes for grass carp, we measured three aspects of their traits: physical properties (firmness, shear force, dry matter content (DMC), ash, and fibrin), nutritional contents (soluble protein and ly- sine) and chemical contents (tannins and flavonoids). All trait measurements were performed on randomly chosen plant samples.
Firmness and shear force of four macrophytes were exam- ined at 2 cm from the top of each plant, using a texture ana- lyzer (TA. XT Plus). DMC was determined following Elger and Lemoine (). Ash content was assessed according to the methods described by Qiu and Kwong (). Fibrin was

measured at 620 nm after dissolving dried macrophytes with 60% mass/volume sulfuric acid and adding 2% mass/volume anthranone. Soluble protein content of macrophytes was de- termined at 595 nm after grinding the plant material and using Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 to react. Lysine was mea- sured at 500 nm after degreasing dried ground macrophytes with 60-90 degC petroleum ether for 8 h and addition of ninhy- drin. The amount of tannins was estimated using permanga- nate titration methods, where the solution turned bright golden yellow after slow addition of 0.1 mol L-1 KMnO4. The con- centration of flavonoids was analyzed at 510 nm after addition
of 5% mass/volume NaNO2, 10% mass/volume Al(NO3)3, and 4% mass/volume NaOH into the 70% ethanol extract. All analyses for the same individual macrophytes were per- formed in triplicates except for firmness and shear force, which were conducted in quintuplicates.

Effects of PSMs on the activity of intestinal proteinases

Crude extract was obtained from M. spicatum using the same method as described above. We then prepared five concentra- tions of PSMs solutions (0, 18, 180, 1800, 18,000 mg flavo- noids*L-1). The solutions were stored at 4 degC until enzyme assays were conducted.

Effects on protease activity

Intestinal tracts were dissected from five grass carp and divid- ed into three sections (foregut, midgut, and hindgut). After removing the gut contents by ice-cold stoke-physiological sa- line solution, the tissues were homogenized at a ratio of 1 g tissue: 9 mL phosphate buffer saline (PBS, 0.1 mol/mL,  pH 8.0). After centrifugation at 12,000 r min-1 for 20 min at 4 degC, three kinds of intestinal crude enzymes were obtained and incubated with the five PSM concentrations separately for 10 min at 37 degC, followed by addition of 0.5% casein to react at 37 degC for 20 min. Then, 10% trichloroacetic acid was added to terminate the reaction, and optical density (OD) was mea- sured at 680 nm after the addition of 0.55 mol L-1 Na2CO3 and Folin-Phenol to react at 37 degC for 15 min. The unit of protease activity in the fish intestine is described as unit per gram proteases. Briefly, 1 U g-1 prot is expressed as 1 g pro- teases hydrolyzing casein to generate 1 mg tyrosine at 37 degC for 1 min. All analyses were performed in triplicates.

Effects on trypsin activity

Trypsin activity in the foregut, midgut, and hindgut of grass carp was determined by spectrophotometry using kits from the Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (Nanjing, China). The unit of enzyme activity was expressed as unit*per milli- gram proteases based on the manufacturer's recommenda- tions, which was expressed as the equivalent enzyme activity



required to generate an optical density (OD) change of
0.003 at pH 8.0 and 37 degC. All analyses were performed in triplicates.
Effects of PSMs on the bacterial community in grass carp intestine.
Two treatments were used: one containing six fish that were fed food pellets containing H. verticillata only (HV) and another containing six fish that were fed food pellets containing
H. verticillata with crude extracts from M. spicatum at a concen- tration of 1.00 PSMs (HVP). The food pellets were prepared in the same way as described above. The fish were fed twice a day (09:00, 15:00 h) with 30 g food pellets to last 40 days in the two aquaria, which were filled with water of 26 degC from the same source that was changed once a day. At the end of the experi- ment, four fish from each aquarium were chosen randomly and their percentage weight gain (PWG) was calculated as [(Wf - W0)/ W0]x 100%, where W0 and Wf were the masses of grass carp before and after the experiment, respectively (Wang et al. ).
The intestinal contents were then collected from each fish and stored in a refrigerator using the same method as described by Wu et al. (). DNA extraction, PCR, and high-throughput 16S rRNA pyrosequencing of each sample were performed fol- lowing the methods described by Borsodi et al. ().

Data analysis

All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS IBM Statistics version 23, Illinois, USA. RCR of each feeding assay, physical/nutritional/chemical traits of submerged macrophytes, and the proteinases activity of each gut were assessed the dif- ferences (P < 0.05) by using one-way ANOVA, followed by the Tukey post hoc tests to identify homogenous groups. PWG of grass carp and microorganisms of HV and HVP at genus level were compared using independent samples t test, respectively. For sequence analysis of gut microbiota, the Shannon in- dex was determined on the base of the calculated operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by Mothur ver. 1.30.1 (Giatsis et al. ). The sequences gained were phylogenetically classified to the phylum and genus levels at 97% similarity for the com- munity composition analysis. MEGA 6.0 was used to depict a phylogenetic tree with the neighbor-joining algorithm. The representative sequences from each OTU were subjected to the RDP-II Classifier of the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) and the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) BLAST for taxonomic analysis.


Results and discussion

Feeding assays

When grass carp were offered four different species of fresh submerged macrophytes for 2 h, their RCR ranged from

1.50% for M. spicatum to 7.29% for H. verticillata. There were significant differences in the RCR among macrophyte treatments (one-way ANOVA, d.f. =  3, F  =  104.237,  P < 0.001). The order of RCR of the four macrophyte species was H. verticillata > V. natans > C. demersum > M. spicatum (Fig. a). Combined with the results in Fig. that the order of the firmness of each species was M. spicatum > C. demersum
> H. verticillata = V. natans and the order of shear force was
M. spicatum > C. demersum > H. verticillata > V. natans, this indicated that an increase in firmness and shear force can

decrease RCR of grass carp, and macrophyte selection by grass carp can be determined, at least in part, by the structure of submerged macrophytes.


The RCR of reconstituted macrophytes by grass carp dif- fered among species, but there was no significant difference between H. verticillata, V. natans, and C. demersum (one-way

ANOVA, d.f. = 2, F = 3.732, P = 0.089) (Fig. b). Compared
with RCR of fresh macrophytes, RCR was less for reconstituted macrophytes (Fig. a, b). This suggested that the lyopholization-grinding process may degrade cells, caus- ing secondary metabolites to be released more readily, leading to decreased intake by grass carp. M. spicatum was the least palatable when presented either as fresh or reconstituted plant matter. When the crude extracts from M. spicatum were com- bined with the most palatable H. verticillata, the RCR of grass carp decreased while the dose of PSMs increased (one-way ANOVA, d.f. = 4, F = 107.646, P < 0.001). After adding 0.5
PSMs or more, the feeding rates were as little as 0 (Fig. c). These results suggested that PSMs have a significant effect on reducing the RCR of grass carp, presumably due to recogni- tion by olfaction or gustation. PSMs of M. spicatum were determined to be quantitative defenses and dose dependent (Hay ). PSMs contain many chemical deterrents such as tannins and flavonoids (Table S1). Furthermore, some reports have demonstrated that herbivores exhibit low preference for plants with relatively high levels of secondary metabolites (Parker et al. ; Dorenbosch and Bakker ; Goodman
and Hay ; O'brien and Scheibling ).

Effects on trypsin activity

In the foregut, trypsin activity was significantly improved at concentrations of 180, 1800, and 18,000 mg L-1 PSMs com- pared to the concentrations of 0 and 18 mg L-1 (one-way ANOVA, d.f. = 4, F = 10.765, P = 0.001). In the midgut, there was a significant difference only at the concentration of 18,000 mg L-1 PSMs  (one-way  ANOVA,  d.f.  =  4, F = 4.423, P = 0.026). However, in the hindgut, trypsin activ- ity was not affected by different concentrations of PSMs (one- way ANOVA, d.f. = 4, F = 0.807, P = 0.548). (Fig. ).
The results above suggest that PSMs of M. spicatum can improve the activity of intestinal proteinases, which is a contrast to research showing that tannins, phenolics, and some specific monoterpenes can limit protein digestibility in terrestrial organisms intestine (Lowry et al. ; Niho et al. ; Dearing et al. b; Degabriel et al. ; Kohl et al. ;). Additionaly, Mouradov and Spangenberg () demonstrated that flavonoids inhibit activity of

results demonstrated that low levels of PSMs did not affect protease activity, and that high levels can contribute to improving the activity.

proteinases. The reason for this may be that the inhibition caused by these metabolites was much less than the im- provement from other molecules that were not detected or tested for.

Effects of PSMs on the bacterial community in grass carp intestine

To identify the bacterial communities from eight intestinal con- tent samples, more than 3300 sequences were obtained for each sample. After downstream analyses, 4701 OTUs were obtained at a 97% sequence identity threshold. In each sample, 389 to 887 OTUs were observed. The sequence information and di- versity index (Shannon) of the samples are shown in Table . Hierarchical clustering analysis was used to show the similarity in the bacterial community structure among the eight intestinal content samples (Fig. ). There were two clear clusters

observed: one group consisting of samples collected from HV and another one clustered with samples collected from HVP, which indicated a clear distinction in the bacterial community structure between HV and HVP.
To compare the phylogenetic differences in the compositions of the bacterial community structures of intestinal content in HV and HVP, relative bacterial community abundance was characterized at the phylum and genus levels (Fig. ). At the phylum level, there were 36 phyla classified for each and the major phyla of the samples were uniform, but their relative abundances differed (Fig. a). For example, Proteobacteria, de-
tected as the dominant phylum, were less abundant in HV (60.75-67.24%) than in HVP (67.86-73.58%). However,
Firmicutes (19. 93 - 24. 74  vs. 17.99 - 19.75 %) and
Planctomycetes (1.89-3.97 vs. 0.91-1.86%) were more abun- dant in HV as compared to HVP. At the genus level, the prev- alent species in HV were Exiguobacterium (17.04-22.10%),

Acinetobacter (6.39-7.65%), Methylocystis (3.63-7.06%), and
Blastopirellula (0.42-1.00%). Yet,  Exiguobacterium (13.20-
16.07%),  Acinetobacter (4.09-5.68%), Methylocystis (0.65-
1.58%), and Hydrogenophaga (1.12-1.59%) were dominant in HVP (Fig. b). A comparison analysis of microorganisms with a significant difference between the two treatments (HV vs. HVP) at the genus level showed that the two major species, Exiguobacterium and Acinetobacter, were lower in HVP (t test, for Exiguobacterium, d.f. = 6, F  =  2.793,  P = 0.007; for  Acinetobacter, d.f. =  6,  F  =  0.150, P = 0.004) (Fig. ), suggesting that PSMs have negative effects on the abundance of bacterial community in the grass carp intestine.
As protease-producing, lipase-producing, and cellulase- producing bacteria, Acinetobacter in the digestive tracts of fishes can yield protease, lipase, and cellulose activity (Jiang et al. ; Ray et al. ). Similar to Acinetobacter, the genus Exiguobacterium can secrete alkaline protease (Vishnivetskaya et al. ). Thus, gut microbiota play an essential role in the digestion of food and could be affected by multiple factors, such as diet (Liu et al. ). Therefore, PSMs can lessen enzymatic activity in the intestines by decreasing the abundance of Acinetobacter and Exiguobacterium, which in turn may weaken the metabolic capacity of grass carp and cause series of adverse effects on growth. After feeding for 40 days, the PWG of grass carp in HVP was 1.67% and in HV was 5.45%. The PWG in HVP was significantly lower than that in HV (t test, d.f. = 5.412, F = 5.731, P = 0.012). Thus, the disadvantageous feedback signal for the growth and development of grass carp induced by PSMs may motivate grass carp to feed on the palatable submerged macrophytes with lower PSMs.


Conclusions

This study was undertaken to explore the palatability mecha- nisms in grass carp for submerged macrophytes. The results

demonstrated that the order of palatability of the four species of fresh submerged macrophytes species was H. verticillata >
V. natans > C. demersum > M. spicatum. These results dem- onstrated that not only the structure of macrophytes but also PSMs played roles in affecting palatability for grass carp. Higher firmness and shear force can decrease the RCR of grass carp. And higher content of PSMs can reduce palatabil- ity of macrophytes by significantly decreasing the abundance of Exiguobacterium, Acinetobacter-yielding protease, lipase, and cellulose activity, but not by weakening the activity of intestinal proteinases.
