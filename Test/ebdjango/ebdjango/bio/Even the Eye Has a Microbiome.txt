Even the Eye Has a Microbiome
A study conducted at the National Eye Insti- tute (NEI) suggests that the eye, like so many other parts of the body, possesses its own microbiome that protects against ophthal- mic infections.
"We've established the proof of con- cept of a central ocular microbiome," Anthony St. Leger, PhD, research fellow in NEI's Laboratory of Immunology, said in a . Citing abundant evidence that "good" gut bacteria have a key role in modulating immunity, he said, "Now we show that this relationship exists in the eye. That's important for how we think about treating ocular disease."
The research team, which was led by Rachel Caspi, PhD, senior investigator in the laboratory, employed a mouse model of ocular surface disease to reveal the pres- ence of a bacterial commensal, namely Co- rynebacterium mastitidis (C mastitidis), which they showed elicited an interleukin-17 response from gd T cells in the ocular mu- cosa. This in turn, "drove neutrophil recruit- ment and the release of anti-microbials into the tears and protected the eye from pathogenic Candida albicans or Pseudomo- nas aeruginosa infection," they wrote in the journal .
In the future, the researchers hope to in- vestigate why C mastitidis is not eradicated by the very immune response it triggers.
Caspi said it is likely that human eyes con- tain similar bacterial communities. "There is no reason why this would be unique to mice," she Time.

Vaccines Protect Fetus From Zika Researchers funded in part by the National Institutes of Health have recently demon- strated that 2 experimental vaccines can re- strict transmission of Zika virus from preg- nant mice to their fetuses, thereby shielding offspring from congenital damage or death.
Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against infection with the virus in animal studies, with sev- eral now in human trials, but none were tested in the context of pregnancy, accord- ing to the authors of the published in Cell. The 2 vaccine candidates investigated

in the new study are the first to demon- strate efficacy in preventing vertical trans- mission of the virus and related fetal death in an animal model. Although the vaccines were administered to female mice prior to pregnancy, the result is considered an important step toward developing a vac- cine that could be safely given to preg- nant women.
One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine encoding Zika genes, developed by the biotechnol- ogy company Moderna. It is already in safety trials in women who are not pregnant. The other is a live-attenuated Zika strain devel- oped by researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB).
The testing was carried out by scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and In- fectious Diseases, Washington University School of Medicine, and UTMB. The re- searchers first vaccinated the mice with 1 of the vaccines or a placebo. After mating, the animals were challenged with the virus 6 days into pregnancy. Aweek later, more than 50% of placentas and fetuses from mice ad- ministered the mRNA vaccine had virtually no Zika RNA. The remainder had "substan- tially lower" levels relative to placebo.
The live vaccine provided broader pro- tection: 78% of placentas and 83% of fe- tuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of detection, while the placebo group exhib- ited significantly higher levels of placental and fetal Zika RNA. Mice vaccinated with either vaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability; whereas 100% of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vac- cine were born, none survived to term in the placebo group.
A working group funded by the Well- come Trust recently approved ethical guidelines for testing such vaccines in preg- nant women, normally excluded from drug trials.

Open Access Data Tool for Cancer Research
The National Cancer Institute recently un- veiled a new web interface forexploring can- cer genomic data online, in real time, with- out the need to download or process the data.



















Researchers demonstrate that the eye has a unique microbiome capable of protecting against infections.


The interface, referred to as Data Analy- sis, Visualization, and Exploration Tools (DAVE), is intended to be used as an ana- lytic resource for cancer researchers that complements the NCI Genomic Data Com- mons (GDC) launched by the agency in 2016. Since its introduction, GDC has gathered and harmonized more than 4.5 petabytes of diverse cancer genomic data, and the NCI hopes that scientists worldwide will apply DAVE's pattern-recognition and other skills to
mine this vast storehouse of information.
According to , DAVE will enable researchers "to explore GDC data by creating customizable patient cohorts; visualize the most frequently mu- tated genes and genes affected by high- impact mutations annotated in the Cancer Gene Census; perform survival analysis by af- fected genes; view mutations mapped to protein-coding regions; and generate and ex- port publication-ready figures."
In a, Louis Staudt, MD, PhD, di- rector of NCI's Center for Cancer Genomics, said the agency's aim in creating both the GDC and DAVE is to enlist the brainpower of the entire research community.
"To make diverse discoveries about an exceedingly complex disease, we need great scientific minds across different disci- plines," he said. - Jeff Lyon
