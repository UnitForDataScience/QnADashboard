Wine originally emerged as a serendipitous mix of chemistry and biology, where microorganisms played a decisive role. From these ancient fermentations to the current monitored industrial processes, winegrowers and winemakers have been continuously changing their practices according to scientific knowledge and advances. A new enology direction is emerging and aiming to blend the complexity of spontaneous fermentations with industrial safety of monitored fermentations. In this context, wines with distinctive autochthonous peculiarities have a great acceptance among consumers, causing important economic returns. The concept of terroir, far from being a rural term, conceals a wide range of analytical parameters that are the basis of the knowledge-based enology trend. In this sense, the biological aspect of soils has been underestimated for years, when actually it contains a great microbial diversity. This soil-associated microbiota has been described as determinant, not only for the chemistry and nutritional properties of soils, but also for health, yield, and quality of the grapevine. Additionally, recent works describe the soil microbiome as the reservoir of the grapevine associated microbiota, and as a contributor to the final sensory properties of wines. To understand the crucial roles of microorganisms on the entire wine making process, we must understand their ecological niches, population dynamics, and relationships between 'microbiome- vine health' and 'microbiome-wine metabolome.' These are critical steps for designing precision enology practices. For that purpose, current metagenomic techniques are expanding from laboratories, to the food industry. This review focuses on the current knowledge about vine and wine microbiomes, with emphasis on their biological roles and the technical basis of next-generation sequencing pipelines. An overview of molecular and informatics tools is included and new directions are proposed, highlighting the importance of -omics technologies in wine research and industry.

INTRODUCTION
Wine is a product with high sociocultural interest. In particular, wines with distinctive autochthonous properties have a great demand among consumers and collectors, causing important economic consequences. It is well known that physical (climate) and biological factors (soil, grape variety and fauna), as well as viticulture and enological techniques work together to determine the sensory-characteristics of a wine from a particular region, establishing the concept of terroir. In this sense it should be noted that, apart from these factors, recent studies highlight the contribution of the native vine microbiota in the winemaking process of wines from a particular region (, ; , ). Additionally, results from  (),  () correlate human-agronomical practices in vineyards with the soil and grape microbiota and, also with its later behavior at cellar, reinforcing the interdependence between the anthropogenic and microbiological basis of terroir.
Microbes transform plant products into socio-economically important products and fermented beverages, such as wine, which is an extremely important sector for several countries. For instance, the International Organization of Wine and Vine (OIV) estimated in 2015 that the global wine-growing surface area was 7,534,000 hectares, with the biggest producer being Italy (18% of the global total), followed by France (17.3%) and Spain (13.5%). Outside the EU, the USA has the highest wine production followed by Argentina, Chile and Australia (, ).
Due to the economic importance  of  the  grapevine,  this  crop has received considerable interest among researchers; although this attention mainly focuses on the  plant  genome  and transcriptome/metabolome to better understand how the plant responds to the physical environment, abiotic stresses and diseases (e.g., the International Grape Genome Program, IGGP). However, plants cannot be considered a self-contained, isolated organism, as plant fitness is a consequence of the plant per se and its associated microbiota (, ). Thus, a more holistic conception should include plant-microorganisms and microbe-microbe interactions.
Although the role of microorganisms at cellar stages  has been well investigated, the biological aspect of soils has not received similar attention, when actually it contains a great microbial diversity with important roles in plant nutrition and health (, ; , ). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches have uncovered a higher than expected microbial diversity in both vine  and wine and discovering new microbial species, some with unknown contributions to the organoleptic properties of wines ( , ). Stable differences among microbial populations of grape musts have been attributed to grape variety, geographical area, climatic factors and vine and grape health, leading to the concept of vine microbial terroir (, ). This fact has been reinforced at a phenotype-metabolome level by other works such as (), (), and (). The later observed distinctive and clustered metabolic profiles (production of hydrolytic enzymes) for yeast strains depending on their geographical origin. It has been also observed that the origin of these microorganisms in musts is

the microbial consortia of grapes, with the original reservoir of these microorganisms being vineyard soil (, ). Thus, the microbiological aspects of  wine  production are influenced by the vineyard and not just by the winery and fermentative processes.
The maturation of grapes is a complex process that depends on numerous factors (, ). Traditionally, the most common measured parameters include: sugar concentration, acidity and aromatic and phenolic maturity. However, soil and grape microbiological complexity throughout the cycle of the vine and grape maturation is rarely taken into consideration.
Communities of microorganisms (fungi, yeast and bacteria) associated with the vineyard play an important role in soil productivity as well as disease resistance developed by the vine. It is important to understand the microbial consortia associated with particular diseases, such as Esca, Eutypa, Botryosphaeria, and Phomopsis diebacks, and also the dynamics of infection processes in order to take preventive actions, especially at the most critical moments (). For instance, microbial insights are crucial for defining strategies for the preparation of new plantings. At this stage, it could be interesting to improve the microbiological conditions of the soil by bioremediation and to avoid risk of cross infection during pruning (, ; , ).
The diversity  and  number  of  microorganisms  that  are able to establish in an  ecological  niche  in  the  soil  and  on  the vine will determine both the grapes' health and the variability of microorganisms that will be introduced in the winery that further affect  the  fermentation  processes  and  wine maturation (, ). Thus, with adequately managed microbiome information, it could be possible to prevent fermentation problems, volatile acidity increases, Brettanomyces contamination and biogenic amines production. Knowing more about the microbiological conditions of the vineyard allows the winegrower to think about the reduction of chemical treatments and performing them only when they are objectively necessary. Additionally, this knowledge would help  the  winemaker  to  use  lower  sulfur  concentration  at  cellar  stages  and  even     to decide  the  type  of  yeast  and  dose  to  be  inoculated  if  and when necessary (). This is valued information especially considering new enology trends, such as organic wines.
Next-generation sequencing technologies enable the detection and quantification of microorganisms present in vineyard soil, grapes, as well as its transformation later in winery. The impact of the microbiological component of terroir and how it contributes not only to its  quality  but  also  in  the  organoleptic  features  of the wine is considerable. This  impact  also  contributes  to the sensory regional distinctiveness and the wine style of the winery that currently plays an important role in differentiation and competitiveness in the worldwide market. If something can distinguish one vineyard from another, among other factors, it certainly is its microbial community. In this context, the objective of this review is to summarize  the  current  knowledge  about the role of microbial communities in viniculture, highlighting the contributions of NGS technologies and identifying new scientific-industrial frontiers.
















































THE MICROBIOME OF VINE AND WINE: A REVIEW
Plants host a variety of microorganisms (fungi, yeast, and bacteria) on and inside organs and their surrounding soil. Among these inhabitants are both harmful  and  beneficial  microbes  that are involved in crucial functions such  as  plant nutrition and plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, hence  in  plant growth promotion, fruit yield, disease resistance and survival (, ; , ; , ).


Studies on microorganisms associated with grapevines have been centered on the cultivable fungi (mainly yeast) or bacteria that can  have  a  negative  economic  impact,  compromising  the yield and quality of the grapevine, as well as wine production. Studies have focused on disease causing pathogens (Agrobacterium vitis, Xylella fastidiosa, Erysiphe necator, Phomopsis viticola, Fusarium spp., etc.) and microorganisms of enological interest. The later species have been grouped into three classes [reviewed in ()]: (1) easily controllable or innocent species, without the ability to spoil wine when good manufacturing practices are applied; (2) fermenting species



responsible for sugar and malic acid conversion; and (3) spoilage sensu stricto species responsible for wine alteration The most widely known cultivable bacteria are acetic acid bacteria (AAB; e.g., Acetobacter and Gluconacetobacter) and lactic acid bacteria (LAB; e.g., Lactobacillus, Oenococcus, and Pediococcus). Among yeasts, Saccharomyces members have attracted most of the attention as they are the main fermentation agents commonly used as inocula (e.g., Saccharomyces cerevisiae, S. bayanus, S. pastorianus, and S. paradoxus among others), while other genera are the most frequent wine spoilers (e.g., Brettanomyces/Dekkera, Issatchenkia, Zygoascus, and Zygosaccharomyces).
While culture dependent methods have been  useful  to  detect and identify microbial organisms associated with grapevine and grape products,  and  also  to  study  in  vitro  their metabolic  properties  (,  ),  they  have  led to a rather biased picture of the microbial  community.  These  methods  neglect  the  larger,  non-culturable  fraction that is believed to be as high as the 95-99% of the microorganisms present (,  ;  ,  ).  In wine environment, due to the stressful environment  associated to the addition of SO2, high ethanol concentration, etc., a fraction of the bacteria and yeast enter in a Viable But Non-Culturable state (VBNC) (, ; , ). At this state cells do  not  grow on culture media, however, they are still viable and maintain a detectable metabolic activity (, ) which may affect fermentation performance as well as flavor. Examples of such microorganisms include Candida stellata, Brettanomyces bruxellensis, S. cerevisiae, Zygosaccharomyces bailii, etc. (, ). Thus, in order to reach to these VBNC microbiologists were driven to develop alternative culture-independent techniques. Particularly, quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) has been widely used to detect bacteria and yeast considered to be wine spoilers and that have VBNC strains responsible for the production of off-flavors or having a negative impact on wine, e.g., Brettanomyces spp. (, ). Nowadays, qPCR is believed to be a rapid diagnostic tool to detect the presence and quantify the abundance of particular microorganisms of interest, however, when  the  objective  is  not a targeted species, but rather a whole community analysis, PCR-DGGE has been the classical method of choice. The later technique is adequate to approximate the total community profile and for comparative community structure analysis, but   it has several drawbacks mainly associated to biases  related with species richness estimates and its low sensitivity to detect low abundance species (, ). For instance, multiple bands could associate with single isolates. In addition, multiple sequences might be associated with  a  single  band  and preferential amplification biases between phylogenetically diverse members of the community have been shown (  , ).  () compared the population dynamics of microorganisms of grape must fermentation by three culture independent techniques (DGGE, direct cloning of amplified DNA, and qPCR) with plate counting, and evidenced that the biodiversity observed in the must and at the beginning of fermentation was much higher when DGGE or direct cloning were used. However, the predominance of certain yeast such as

C. zemplinina and S. cerevisiae during fermentation limited the detection of low abundant species. Thus, while DGGE is believed to give a quick and non-expensive view of the community, it skews microbial diversity estimates  (,  )  and it has a limited use to study diverse environmental samples dominated by few species (, ). When adding NGS technique into the detectability comparition of culture independent techniques to study  yeast  community  in  must  and ferments, the studies evidenced that larger numbers  of  yeast species were detectable by NGS than by PCR-ITS-RFLP or DGGE in grape samples. Moreover NGS detected species    in ferment samples that were undetectable with the two later techniques (, ). In addition, () analyzed Carignan and Granache grape must and fermentation from three vineyards in Priorat (Spain) and found that NGS detected all the species identified by the rest of methods (DGGE, qPCR and culture dependent), whereas DGGE could just detect the dominant species of non-Saccharomycetes class. Thus, NGS showed to be more appropriate to understand must and wine environment yeast communities (, ; ,).
Next-generation sequencing technologies are providing a powerful approach to achieve a more complete understanding of the complexities of microbial communities and their impact on plant growth, disease resistance/susceptibility, climate adaptation and environmental remediation. This technology is enabling researchers to simultaneously obtain information on thousands of taxa as opposed to targeted approaches that detect only a taxonomically predefined group. Thus, metagenomics coupled with new bioinformatics tools, is allowing performance of more complex multifactorial analyses and is becoming a powerful strategy in diagnostics, monitoring, and traceability of products. Its application in viticulture while recent is promising (), as accumulating data suggest that there is a much higher microbial diversity associated both with the plant ( , ; , ; , ) and the fermentation process (, ; , ; , ; , ; , ) compared to previous culture based studies. Most metagenomics research in this field has focused on microbial monitoring during fermentation to obtain a detailed description of the relevant microbial populations associated with grape and must that might lead to wine spoilage, an advance highly valuable for winemaking. These NGS-enabled studies reflect a wider range of bacteria, besides the commonly detected LAB and acetic acid species, able to persist in fermenting musts of various grape varieties (, ; , ; , ; , ). For instance, the first wine-related study conducted in the wine environment with NGS was conducted by () during botrytized wine fermentation using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. These authors showed an array of fluctuating low abundant taxa not traditionally associated with wine, as well as atypical LAB communities during the process. Similarly, results from () suggested that AAB are more abundant and dynamic than previously thought during low or unsulfited wine fermentations, and seemed to be independent of the grape variety. Interestingly, in this

study yeast diversity and dynamics during wine fermentation was assessed in addition to bacteria, evidencing that the genera Hanseniaspora and Candida were dominant during the initial and mid- spontaneous fermentation of Grenache grapes while certain Candida and Saccharomyces species predominated at the end of the fermentation. Other studies have demonstrated how different fermentation techniques (spontaneous vs. inoculated) affect the microbial community composition and its succession during fermentation (, ), and also how the previous agronomical practices in the vineyard could  play  a  critical  role in these population dynamics (, ). These authors' results indicated certain phyla are  associated with each particular technique. Interestingly, they observed that Gluconobacter experienced a notable increase during organic fermentation, which led the authors to conclude that this might explain the increased susceptibility to wine spoilage in wines produced using that technique.
These above-mentioned studies enhance our understanding  of microbial diversity during fermentation and allow the identification microbial contamination sources. However, as DNA sequencing approaches detects living as well as dead microorganisms, it is still not clear to what extent these microorganisms metabolically are active and capable of affecting organoleptic properties of wine. The role of the microbiota influencing the flavor, color and quality of wine, under a systems biology perspective, remained elusive until recently.
While soil, weather, farming techniques and grape variety contribute to the unique qualities of wine, adding distinctiveness and thus market value, the contribution of the microbiota in defining terroir is now in the spotlight of scientific research. Regionally distinct wines are highly appreciated by consumers and add value to the industry. In Spain alone there are

The later was further proved in  (); these authors demonstrated that both grape microbiota and wine metabolite profiles were able to distinguish viticultural area designations and individual vineyards within Napa and Sonoma Counties in CA, USA. Interestingly, the vineyard microbiota correlated with the chemical composition of the finished wines, hinting at the possibility of predicting wine phenotypes prior to fermentation. Nevertheless, wine aroma is defined by hundreds of chemical compounds with different natures (i.e., higher alcohols, esters, fatty acids, terpenes, thiols) causing a broad spectrum of sensory thresholds, and also suffering synergies and antagonisms (, ). Thus, looking for microbial signatures determining wine typicity, the sensorial characterization of wines should consider not only chromatographic analysis (revealing the diversity and concentration of aroma compounds), but also developing serious sensorial or olfactometry analysis to reflect the real perception of wine aroma or, at least, considering odor activity values (OAVs) to correlate the real influence of microbial species in wine aroma, as was addressed by ().
While grape and must have been more heavily researched,  () further hypothesized that the soil  and its associated microbiota influences wine characteristics. First, per these authors' studies, the aboveground bacterial community was significantly influenced by soil edaphic factors such as total carbon, moisture and soil temperature, which would ultimately impact the quality of grapes due to changes in nutrient availability for the plant. Second, soil bacterial communities differed between the sampled vineyards in Long Island, New York and those differences were reflected in the microbial composition in vine roots. These root endophytes can shape the microbial assemblages of aboveground organs by changing the endophytic microbial loads in grapes. Third, a significant input of soil microorganisms to grapes through epiphytic migration during harvest was suggested. The later was also evidenced by   (), leading   ()  to  propose that soil derived microorganisms could have a greater role than previously anticipated in wine, as they will ultimately end up    in the fermentation tanks. The link between soil microbiota



and terroir was further evidenced by  () who identified distinctive microbial community profiles by American Viticultural Areas (AVA).

NGS MICROBIAL PROFILING: KEY STEPS, BIASES AND LIMITATIONS
The above summarized studies were conducted on grapevines and  wine  and  address   microbial   composition   by   means   of 16s rDNA PCR amplicon and ITS (Internal Transcribed spacer) NGS sequencing for elucidating the bacterial and fungi community, respectively. This marker gene amplification and sequencing method, also called amplicon sequencing, has become the method of choice to simultaneously detect multiple species in must and wine environment since 2012 (see , , ; , , ; , , among others). However, the particular experimental question of the research to be conducted will determine the method mostly suited to answer to the question. For instance, if the goal is to track a particular microbial strain or genus from soil to must     to fermentation, then qPCR could be a more appropriate and  has the added benefit of absolute quantification (, ). To detect a specific microbe, primers must be designed to be highly specific for the microbe of interest. Often the primer design can be completed by genome comparison of targeted and non-targeted strains to find a unique gene or region. Another strategy involves targeting a conserved gene (16S rRNA, gyrB, rpoB) and making sure the primers mismatch off-target strains particularly at the 3t end. Single copy genes provide an added bonus for absolute quantification. Microbe quantification by qPCR, however, does not scale easily if the goal is to analyze more than a few strains while amplicon sequencing is suited to determine the community.
However,   amplicon   sequencing   is   not   free   of  pitfalls,
and  different  biases  have  been  described  in  multiple  steps of the process; First, DNA extraction method  is  one  of  the  key and limiting steps for metagenomic analysis by NGS. Various approaches have  been  applied  for  environmental DNA extraction, including freeze-thaw lysis (, ), bead beating (, ; , ; , ; , ), liquid nitrogen grinding (, ), ultrasonication (, ), hot detergent treatment (, ), use of strong chaotropic agents like guanidinium salts (, ), and high concentration of lysozyme treatment (, ). Furthermore, soil, grapes and wine are complex physicochemical environmental samples that contain many interfering agents for molecular analysis such as impurities, phenols, humic acid, fulvic acid, metal ions and salts, and therefore additional purification steps are necessary which can introduce bias by altering the original community (e.g., a fraction of the community might    be lost through purification, etc.). There are several commercial kits that could be used to fasten the process, however, the selection of the best DNA extraction method and kit is not straightforward as different DNA extraction methods can produce different results (, ). Unfortunately,

there is no "gold standard" for DNA extraction method and one should be selected on a case-by-case basis considering the aims, specimens of the study and scalability (including  simplicity, cost effectiveness, and short handling time) and intended study comparisons. An additional problem is the introduction of contaminating microbial DNA during sample preparation. Possible sources of DNA contamination include molecular biology grade water, PCR reagents and DNA extraction kits themselves. Contaminating sequences matching water-and soil-associated bacterial genera including Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, Bacillus, Bradyrhizobium, Herbaspirillum, Legionella, Leifsonia, Mesorhizobium, Methylobacterium, Microbacterium, Novosphingobium, Pseudomonas, Ralstonia, Sphingomonas, Stenotrophomonas, and Xanthomonas have been reported previously. The presence of contaminating DNA is a particular challenge for researchers working with samples containing a low microbial biomass. In these cases, the low amount of starting material may be effectively swamped by the contaminating DNA and generate misleading results (, ).
Second, DNA library preparation, based on fragment amplification through PCR with barcoded primers, is another step in which it is  possible  to  introduce  additional  biases.  The choice of primers and targeted variable regions will bias identification and quantification (, ;  , ). Additionally, in any PCR- and primer-based taxonomic investigation, members of a microbial community may be omitted, distorted, and/or  misrepresented,  typically  due to primer mismatches or PCR biases (, ; , ; , ; , ; , ). On the contrary, primers might show variability in their amplification efficiency by for example, favoring certain species amplification (,  ;  , ; , ). This preferential amplification is thought to be derived from different sources such as primer mismatches, the annealing temperature and PCR cycle numbers (, ). For instance,  ()' studies evidenced that A. hydrophila and P. fluorescens were preferentially amplified over both Bacillus strains when  the 63F primer was used (which contained three mismatches against DNA isolated from the Bacillus strains), while the 27F primer amplified all templates without bias. Interestingly, the bias introduced by primer mismatches was reduced at lower annealing temperatures.
Multiple primer pairs are available for marker genes, and each pair is associated with its  own  taxon  biases.  Marker  gene databases are frequently updated, and the updated information can include new microbial lineages with suboptimal or poor binding to existing PCR primers; to maximize taxonomic sensitivity in  light  of  these  new  data,  primers  may need to be periodically redesigned. A recent example in   the literature is the modification of the most common 16S primers used 515f and 806r to remove know biases against Crenarchaeota/Thaumarchaeota and the marine and freshwater Alphaproteobacterial clade SAR11 (, ;  , ).
() evaluated the coverage and phylum spectrum for bacteria and archaea of 175 primers and



512 primer pairs in silico for three amplicon size classes (100-400, 400-1000, >1000 bp), demonstrating the differences in coverage and specificity among the studied primers. Besides, this information represents a valuable guideline for selecting primer pairs that could minimize the bias in PCR-based microbial diversity studies. In the same way, probeBase is an additional online resource, providing the opportunity to evaluate the in silico hybridization performance of oligonucleotides, as well as finding suitable hierarchical probes that could target an organism or taxon of interest at different taxonomic levels (,).
The ideal marker gene should have conserved regions that flank variable regions. The conserved regions allow primer design to amplify multiple taxons at ones. Ribosomal rRNA genes fit this description and have been widely used for identification     of bacteria/archaea (16S) and fungi (ITS) (, ). However, ribosomal RNA genes show copy-number variation, with very disparate number of copies per taxa (from one in many species to up to 15 in some bacteria and to hundreds in some microbial eukaryotes) biasing conclusions related to the abundance of the organisms.
To evaluate the entire microbial community in the specific case of the wine ecosystem, it is necessary to strike an appropriate balance between amplifying all members of every taxon (high coverage) and obtaining the highest taxonomic resolution possible, e.g., to be able to discriminate among closely related species (). Each marker shows differences in its discrimination power at intra-genera as well as at intra-species level. Thus researchers must have that in mind when designing their project, in order to choose the most appropriate molecular marker to answer their particular question/s. For instance, primer pair 515f/806r is the most widely used for targeting the V4 region of for bacteria/archaea (, ), and this combined with Illumina sequencing has been used to characterize the microbiomes of numerous environments (, ), vine and wine environments among them. Data  from high diverse environments, as Sakinaw Lake, showed species resolution level from 49.4% of the 16S V4 sequences classified compare with 74.5% using full 16S. Although the relative classification differences at the sequence level do not directly translate to differences in  community  representation  (  , ). However, vine and wine samples have the added difficulty in that mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA can be amplified with these V4 region primers and thus grapevine plastid sequences overwhelm the sequencing. Researcher have two ways to avoid this problem: design primers that mismatch mitochondrial/chloroplast sequences or add blocking reagents that bind these sequences (, ). Besides, the V4 domain of the 16s rDNA gene is considered to be the most suitable marker for capturing the bacterial community in wine, as it is able to reliably discriminate LAB to genus-level ( , ). However, in fermentative systems, some species of LAB are considered wine spoilers while others exhibit malolactic activity, thus it might be essential to reach to species level (, ) and/or strain level, in order to have

1 

a more comprehensive view of the community. Unfortunately, currently available amplicon sequencing markers are unable to capture that level of resolution in all taxa. These limitations could be overcome by combining several techniques such as genera specific T-RFLP or qPCR and amplicon sequencing.
Third, important sources of artifacts are also derived from  the High-throughput sequencing technology chosen. While pyrosequencing introduces homopolymer errors (indel error), Illumina sequencing has average substitution errors at 0,0086 sequencing rate (, ). Sequencing platforms also show a disparity in sequencing depth (number of reads per run) and read length. Illumina MiSeq is the most commonly used sequencer for amplicon sequencing due to its high coverage with a total nucleotide sequenced of 15GB allowing sequencing the abundant  and  rare  community  giving  a  deep  view  of  the community composition. However, llumina sequencing is characterized by a short variable region sequencing (2  300 bp vs. 700 bp in 454). Currently, nearly full-length rRNA gene sequencing is possible with PacBio and Nanopore technologies (, ; , ).
Finally, one of the biggest limitation of amplicon sequencing techniques relays on its inability to address a functional characterization of the microbial communities. There are many desired microbial functions in winemaking, mainly related to alcoholic and malolactic fermentations, and diversity of genes related to those functions may influence winemaking more than just taxonomic diversity. In addition, closely related strains with highly similar 16S rRNA gene or ITS sequences contain different fermentation-related genes (, ) and thus that strain diversity remains hidden in current amplicon sequencing studies. Single-cell genomics emerges as a potential strategy that could help to obtain a deeper knowledge into  species- strain level diversity. This strategy is powerful when the targeted organism is dominant or high abundant in a low species richness ecosystem. However, in highly diverse ecosystems or when the species to be targeted is low abundance, it may require a higher sorting throughput, specific labeling with fluorescent probes or a previous cultivation step, all of which could contribute to biases. Alternatively, shotgun metagenomic sequencing would also reveal functional genes in addition to rRNA genes, allowing a more comprehensive genomic and functional representation through whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of complete communities, but the cost  and  the  number  of  reads  needed to estimate the environmental  population  is  high  compared to PCR-based approaches. Even more in wine  samples, as a very deep sequencing is  required  to  detect  microbes  due  to an overabundance of plant DNA (, ),
making this method costly for a large number of samples.
Metatranscriptomics is emerging as a powerful technology for the functional characterization of microbial communities  that can reveal both the taxonomic composition and active biochemical functions of the detected organisms. These approach is of especial interest in wine environment, as amplicon sequencing is not able to discriminate among living or dead organisms, nor the metabolically active or inactive organisms. However, the high sequencing depth needed and the high cost associated with the sequencing of each sample limits the number



of samples that could be surveyed within a project currently.    In addition, challenges associated with this technique include among others, the lack of established reference genomes to annotate the short reads generated in the sequencing and the high computational effort needed for the analyzes. Being a technique still in its infancy, new analysis tools and standardized pipelines are under development. In this context, the next section aims    to summarize critical concepts and sources of biases in NGS analysis.

BIOINFORMATICS AND PREDICTIVE METHODS TO UNCOVER THE MICROBIAL TERROIR
Along with the relative ease with which thousands of organisms can be detected in samples via 16S/ITS sequencing, a whole host of bioinformatics approaches have been developed to extract meaningful results from the large datasets that are generated. The bioinformatics challenge comes in at least two parts
(I) preprocessing the datasets into a collection of representative reads (or operational taxonomic unit - OTU) that can be associated with databases of known species and (II) associating the collection of species inferred in a sample (known and newly detected) with properties of the sample in order to study the relationships between the microbiome and the terroir.
In the first stage, the large amounts of raw sequencing reads are processed (trimming adaptor sequences, merging forward and reverse sequences, filtering on read quality) before finally being dereplicated into a collection of unique sequences. There is a lot of software available to perform these tasks and they often are part of packages that offer an entire processing pipeline (USEARCH, vsearch, FASTX-Toolkit) (, ;   , ). The unique sequences are then clustered according to sequence similarity, choosing a relatively arbitrary cutoff at 97% identity (, ), resulting in a set of OTUs that are each assumed to be originating from a specific organism. In other words, OTUs are proxies for microbial species in the sample (, ; , ).
Although conceptually simple, this step poses major challenges both computationally and in terms of biases that might potentially bleed into subsequent analysis. First of all, for large sets of sequences, all against all pairwise alignments would be prohibitive, e.g., 1 million of unique sequences (commonly encountered), would require 1000 billion pairwise comparisons. This has led to comprehensive bioinformatics pipelines for  OTU clustering, including the software pipelines mentioned above (USEARCH, vsearch, swarm), which all rely on clever heuristics (, ; , ; , , ; , ; , ) in order to accelerate this process at the expense of perfectly accurate clustering. The second challenge is to avoid biases that can occur during OTU clustering. The biases can be multifold; (a) different biological species might have the same sequence and therefore be grouped into one set, (b) sequencing errors or amplification errors (including chimeric reads) or untrimmed sequences can group sequences that have the same origin into separate groups. The

first issue will underestimate biological diversity whereas the latter will overestimate it. Together these scenarios will corrupt the accurate representation of the real biological makeup of the terroir. This highlight again that it is important to quality trim and filter the raw sequences to minimize the risk of including artifacts in environmental data sets.
Finally, the curated OTUs are subjected to phylogenetic assignment, which aims to identify what species or genus an OTU most likely belongs to. This is achieved by comparing them with taxonomically classified sequences at databases, such as GreenGenes (for bacteria community characterization), SILVA (bacteria and eucaryotes) and Unite (for Fungi) among others. Again, a range of software is available (Qiime, UTAX, SINTAX, stampa) (, ; , , ). This stage  is again a source of biases, partly because OTUs can represent multiple species, there is ambiguous assignment, and because too small differences that do exist could be ignored by these methods. For instance, in the case of Oligotyping, a single base pair can differentiate ecological strains (, ). Furthermore, and more generally, reference databases are themselves based largely on predicted species rather than experimentally cultivated species and can thus bias taxonomic assignment. Additionally, different reference databases would yield different taxonomic assignments as a function of completeness and quality of the database (, ). Notably, if a given species    is not represented within the database, sequences derived from that species would receive an incorrect assignment or remain unclassified. This is aggravated for wine and soil associated microbial sequences field, where reference databases lag behind human-associated microbes. Increasing and curating robust databases is a key goal for the scientific community (). There are also other methods allowing comparison of amplicons derived from functional genes in which we might not know percent  identities  that  correspond  to  taxonomic  levels,  but  in some cases, are optimal to reflect geographical (and thus, environmental) distance (, ). In relation to wine related samples, cluster free methods show the potential to define the microbial terroir at the strain or sub-OTU level (, ; , ).
Equipped with a dataset of biological entities in the terroir (genus- or species-level), the second bioinformatics challenge concerns associating the microbiome to the properties of the terroir. Depending on the aim, this can be more or  less  difficult. One goal is to use microbial community data to  classify soil samples into types and geographical regions and, therefore, define the microbial terroir. Recently,  () demonstrated the power of this approach for classifying Californian regions and fermentation metabolites based on microbial abundances in musts. However, if species or even strain information is required to establish an association between microbiome and specific wine making properties, then the taxonomic assignment is essential and can make or break an analysis depending on the resolution it achieves and the biases  it can prevent.
Apart from the nature of the question, generally, the structure of OTU abundance data poses  some  challenges  that  need to be carefully taken into account. Because the species can occur



in very different abundances (often spanning several orders of magnitude), the collection of species across samples can greatly vary. This leads to a very sparse dataset, which is defined as      a dataset with many zero values. These zero values can be problematic as they could entertain multiple hypotheses; for instance, a zero count in a sample could be because a species    is not present, or because it just has not been detected. This    can lead to biased comparisons between samples. One way to deal with this is to use distance metrics that do not consider these situation (e.g.,  Bray-Curtis)  or  that  specifically  include a phylogenetic tree that allows to relate  species  information into meaningful groups. Preprocessing of OTU data from raw counts to a value that makes samples comparable to each other  is the next step. This is also referred to as normalization and there are number of analytical choices available (, ; , ) depending on whether low-abundance species or high abundance species should have more of an impact in the analysis inquestion. For instance, counts can be converted to frequencies (divide the number of reads by the  total number of reads in the sample).  The  performance  of  these techniques given OTU table peculiarities has been tested elsewhere (, ; , ). This is also a crucial step when applying machine learning techniques.
With a preprocessed dataset available, the probe community

fungal and oomycete cultures in a common garden to confirm single strain effects on the overall microbial community structure associated with Arabidopsis thaliana (, ).
Defining the microbial terroir with  bioinformatics  is only an early step to understand how microbes shape each step in winemaking. Wine imparts its taste and smell via metabolites, many derived from the grapes and many derived from or modified by microbes. Identifying which microbes influence these processes is key to defining how they affect the sensory profile of wines. As we add genomic sequences to  our  reference database we will be able to leverage annotated sequences to predict metabolic capacity for each microbe. Genome scale metabolic models (GSMM) combined with flux balance analysis allows for analysis of metabolic outputs given  a set of inputs (, ). Furthermore,  GSMMs can expand to community-level models ( , ; , ; , ) to uncover how microbes synergistically create complex wine metabolite profiles. Going  forward,  it  will  be  critical  not only to  define  which  microbes  created  your  favorite  wine but also  how  their  metabolisms  shaped  the  taste  of  that wine. Thus, viticulture will benefit very much from the generation of commercial platforms that enable studying vine and wine microbiome and wine metabolome. Currently such

- (Bruker) allowing

prior knowledge of the sample phenotypes. Principle component analysis (PCA or more commonly PCoA) and clustering algorithms can be used to gain a high level view over  differences in samples. These analyses are largely exploratory and provide visual evidence of community differences. If information regarding the terroir is available, or  there  are  some clearly defined groups that are to studied, supervised learning techniques can be applied to for instance classify new samples based on past community characterizations (  , ). Distinct wine regions, types  and  tastes  make  wine related samples well-suited for these classification methods (, ). Different software packages are available to perform these methods and can be more or less adapted to   the study of metagenimics problems (vegan, phyloseq, Qiime, mothur).
Another method to extract knowledge from microbiome data is to consider it as a network of interactions between individual strains. Aside from the impact of single strains in plant health (pathogens, symbionts) and wine characteristics, or spoilage potential, these strains impact wine production not in isolation but instead as members of complex microbial communities. Much research now focuses on these community level effects that can impact plant phenotypes such as flowering time (    , ).
These predictive technologies allow to make initial inferences

wine metabolome analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance. These tools are based on robust databases and allow both producers and regulatory councils from appellations of origins  to establish 'standard profiles' for their wines, and better understand the microbial and chemical bases of their distinctive terroir.

CONCLUSION
In  this  article,  the  impact  of  NGS  technologies  in  vine   and wine microbiology has been reviewed. Regarding the importance of microbiome in viticulture and enology, the role  of microorganisms in the chemical  and  nutritional  properties of vineyard soils,  crop  health  and  yield,  and  also  in  the  later fermentation performance and wine flavor are the main challenges to explore using -omics tools. For that purpose, certain technical aspects should be improved at laboratory stages, such as universal DNA&RNA extraction protocols to avoid biases, and improved sequencing approaches to increase microbiome resolution and quantification. It is also important   to develop robust and curated databases to improve taxonomic assignments (). Finally, it is time to develop big data works, using statistical data-mining and machine learning tools to solve, in a holistic systems-biology view, the above-mentioned challenges in wine industry.

about whether these differentially abundant single OTUs cause	 	

certain phenotypes. However, they will requires further testing, likely with pure  culture  treatments.  One  excellent  example  of going from correlation to causation is the use of pure
