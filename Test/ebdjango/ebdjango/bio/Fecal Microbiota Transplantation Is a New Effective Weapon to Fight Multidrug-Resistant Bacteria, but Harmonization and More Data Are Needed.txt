into consideration time to event and allows analysis of time-dependent var- iables [2, 3]. This is particularly certain when we are taking into consideration the relation with  antibiotic  exposures. In their study, Tamma et al considered antibiotic therapy as a time-fixed varia- ble. Exposure to antibiotics can change during patient admission and may vary during the observation time. Recent publications suggest measuring antibi- otic therapy as a time-dependent vari- able; this would prevent the study from being subject to immortal time bias [4-6].
The authors did not report antibiotic exposures previous to the development of bacteremia. Previous antibiotic expo- sures could have altered the patients' microbiome, increasing the risk of col- onization and infection with antimi- crobial-resistant organisms, and might have an effect in the odds for bacter- emia recurrence and 14-day mortality.
Besides the possible  distortion  on  the results caused by the way antibiotic therapy was measured, there are several implications of Tamma et al's findings. Currently, clinical microbiology labo- ratories are not required or encouraged to perform carbapenemase  detection  test for clinical management; the test is recommended for epidemiological rea- sons (such as infection control purposes to avoid horizontal transmission and cohorting patients)  [7].  Furthermore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention toolkit for CRE prevention and control does not differentiate in the approach between CP-CRE and non-CP CRE [8].
At our institution, we do have a differ- ent approach for patients with CP-CRE compared to non-CP CRE. All new CRE isolates are tested for cabapenemase production using the Carba-NP test [9]; occasionally, if necessary, they are also sent out for polymerase chain reac- tion sequencing. CP-CRE patients have cohorted staff, which many times means a nurse-to-patient ratio of 1:1, and dif- ferent contact precautions signage; in

addition, a daily email with the list of CP-CRE patients currently admitted in the facility is distributed to a select group of clinicians, bed placement, nursing, antimicrobial stewardship, and other healthcare providers [10]. Our approach has enabled us not only to effectively control and prevent the spread of these organisms beyond infection control purposes, but also to inform appropri- ate antibiotic therapy. Each case is ana- lyzed to determine the best combination of antimicrobials based on the possible mechanism of resistance, providing per- sonalized combinations of antimicro- bial regimens for patients where limited options exist in the current antibiotic armamentarium (unpublished data).
We commend Tamma et al for an excellent manuscript with valuable find- ings, which will hopefully encourage others to consider the complexity of anti- biotic exposure as a time-dependent var- iable in the future.

Fecal Microbiota Transplantation Is a New Effective Weapon
to Fight Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria, but Harmonization and More Data Are Needed
To the Editor--We have read with great interest the article by Bilinski et al on fe- cal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in patients with blood disorders [1].
They performed 25 intraduodenal FMTs among 20 immunosuppressed patients colonized with antibiotic-resist- ant bacteria (ARB). FMT was successful in 15 of 25 (60%) procedures at 1 month postprocedure among the 20 patients and 13 of 14 (93%) patients at 6 months.
These results are encouraging and in line with our study among 8 carriers of highly resistant digestive bacteria [2], but some questions still need to be discussed.
Impact  of  immunosuppression:   FMT is usually discouraged in immunocom- promised patients due to possible septic complications [3]. Nonetheless, Bilinsky

et al performed FMT in such patients without septic adverse events, showing it may not be a contraindication for FMT.
Age of patient: Its impact  on  fail-  ure of decolonization by FMT as for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) seems possible.
Antimicrobials prior to FMT: The authors did not use antimicrobials for decolonization prior to FMT, as we did in our study, contrary to Lagier et al [2, 4].
Multiple FMTs: FMT was performed twice among 3 patients and 3 times among 1 patient in this study. This supports the concept of a dose/effect for FMT efficacy as discussed in our study [2]. However, the authors did not provide the indication for these multi- ple FMT procedures; was it because of failure of decolonization?
Fresh vs frozen feces: In our study, we used frozen feces for pragmatic reasons, whereas Bilinsky et al used fresh feces. Hitherto, no difference has been found between fresh vs frozen feces in CDI [5].
Definition of decolonization: the authors defined gut decolonization as a negative result for a minimum of 2 con- secutive rectal swab cultures, but they did not specify the minimum time delay between the 2 swabs, which is of impor- tance as recolonization could often occur, as emphasized by the authors.
The authors showed outstanding results of FMT on ARB decolonization. Yet, we did not meet the same results, with 2 of 8 patients decolonized at 1 month and
3 of 8 at 3 months. This discrepancy could be explained by several factors previously discussed: Our patients were older (median age was 69.5 vs 51 years in Bilinsky et al); only 1 FMT was performed for each patient; frozen feces were used; 5 of our patients received antimicrobials during follow-up, which is significantly associated with failure [1]; and, last, we studied colonization by carbapenem-re- sistant Enterobacteriaceae or vancomy- cin-resistant enterococci, and their rate of decolonization is different according to a recent experimental model [6].

We fully agree with the authors that FMT seems to be a safe and long-lasting response, contrary to only oral antimi- crobial decolonization [7].
Finally, the authors suggested that individuals undergoing allogeneic hema- togenous cell transplantation, colonized with ARB, had a higher mortality rate and lower overall survival rate compared with noncolonized individuals, but this out- come was not evaluated in their study [8]. In conclusion, we need to standardize and harmonize practice to correctly eval- uate FMT, which seems to be a promising
strategy [9].

High-Dose Daptomycin and Mortality: The Case Is Not Yet Closed
To the Editor--In the 1 March 2017 issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases, Britt et al [1] reported on a cohort study of hospitalized Veterans Affairs (VA) pa- tients treated with standard-, medi- um-, or high-dose daptomycin (6, 8, or
>=10 mg/kg total body weight, respective- ly) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus bloodstream infection. Although the authors conclude that high-dose dap- tomycin was associated with improved survival and microbiologic clearance in patients with such infection, we do not believe their data can be interpreted with- out additional information beyond what was presented in the article.
There are several issues concerning the definition and analyses of the primary outcome. It seems that follow-up was truncated at 30 days, and it is not clear how the primary outcome of "overall sur- vival" (P = .002 for standard- and P = .003 for standard-medium-dose daptomycin) differs from the secondary outcome of "30-day all-cause mortality" (P = .042 for daptomycin dose), because the curve presented [1, fig 1] tracks survival only to 30 days. Of the 911 patients analyzed in the study, 843 were no longer being
