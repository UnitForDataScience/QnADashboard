Expression of Concern to: Diabetologia
DOI 

On the basis of the recommendation of the EASD's Scientific Integrity Panel, the Editor-in-Chief is issuing this expression of concern to alert readers to questions about the reliability of some of the data in the article cited above.
In particular it appears that the immunoblots for total IKKb in Fig. 4g and k of this paper may have been duplicated.

In line with guidelines issued by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), the journal has informed the corresponding author, Mario Saad, of this concern. The author's response was considered unsatisfactory and the low resolution of the images provided to us prevented further analysis to conclusively confirm or refute this pos- sible duplication. The University of Campinas (Sao Paulo, Brazil) was asked, in March 2016, to undertake an insti- tutional investigation. As no results from this investigation have been forthcoming this expression of concern is being issued to alert readers to exercise caution when interpreting the content and conclusions of this  article. This expression of concern will remain in place until such a time as further evidence is available.
